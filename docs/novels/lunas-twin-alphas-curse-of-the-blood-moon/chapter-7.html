                <p>&#34;Must be nice to be so effortlessly gorgeous&#34; I heard her say. Her voice was the most perfect thing I had ever heard. Even better than I remembered. My wolf, Apollo, started jumping and wagging his tail. That was the most he&#39;s done in years. He seemed so excited, hell I was excited. That&#39;s my woman. Through the speaker, I could hear the sound of receding footsteps and then the door closing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where she&#39;s going?&#34; I asked. I needed to see her. To hold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha, when I followed her today, I caught a man inviting her to a party. She must be going there.&#34; Greg answered. I noticed the way his heart rate picked up when he mentioned another man talking to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger getting the best of me at the thought of another man being near my mate, I spun around and grabbed Greg by the throat, a dangerously low growl coming from me as my wolf pushed for control, the possessiveness over our mate coming through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this guy? Where is this party?!&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...It...It&#39;s...&#34; He tried responding but couldn&#39;t talk with the pressure of my hand around his throat and my claws coming out, grazing his jugular.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, enough. Take control, we need to focus on getting to Allison.&#34; It was Chad that spoke. At the mention of my mate, my claws immediately went back in my fingers, and I let go of Greg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is this party?&#34; I asked, getting impatient to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We decided it would be best for all of us to go, not knowing what kind of threats were out there. Pulling up to the house where the party was taking place, I saw humans littering the front lawn, some talking in groups, some puking. Making our way to the open front door, my heart dropped into the pit of my stomach. Allison was falling some guy up the stairs of the house her arm, willingly in his hand. He was leading the way. It took every ounce of willpower not to go rip his head off then and there for even looking at her, let alone touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two of you are out front, two out back. Chad, you&#39;re with me. Rory and Greg are main level, pretend to mingle but be on high alert.  I sent out the mindlink to my people around me so that the humans didn&#39;t hear anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad and I started to head up the stairs, when one of my warriors mind linked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha, get to her now. Someone just drugged her, we&#39;re coming! He yelled down the link, panic lacing his tone. I ran up the rest of the stairs and tried opening the door. It was locked. I stepped back and kicked my leg to bust it down. Frantically looking around, she was nowhere to be seen. I heard a thud across the hall. I broke that door down just as fast, again. The room was empty. Where is she? My warriors came up behind me, mindlinking me to keep it private from the humans,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha, I don&#39;t understand one second she was there. I saw her talking to a man, she looked like she was about to leave, then the next moment, I saw a figure prick her with a needle. I told you right away, but she disappeared the next moment. Like the three of them were never there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to make of this information, but I knew for sure that whoever she was with was not human. I have to find out what they are and where they took her. Something else that has been eating away at me since I first saw her. I can&#39;t smell her, she smells human, as if she doesn&#39;t have a wolf at all, which I know is not true. I&#39;ve met her wolf before. She&#39;s my mate, her scent should have hit me before I even saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the f*ck is going on here?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hello lovely readers, what do you think so far? I plan to update 1-2 chapters a day. Hope you&#39;re enjoying, lots of love &lt;3</p>

                <p>Uknown POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Allison went missing, Apollo threatened to break out in front of all of these humans. He wanted to rip this entire place to shreds, humans included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was incredibly hard to keep him controlled, he needed his mate. I needed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad, we need to get out of here before I lose control of Apollo. NOW! I shouted down the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his eyes glaze over, he must be mindlinking the rest of the crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apollo was clawing at my mind, roaring, causing havoc, trying to make me feel the pain of our mate slipping through our fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying to hurt me enough so that he could take over. I couldn&#39;t take that risk in the state he was in now, he would turn this place into a bloodbath trying to find our mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad we need to do something, he&#39;s going to take over! I shouted down the link, grabbing my head with my hands as it started to throb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LET ME OUT! Apollo roared in my mind. I could feel my eyes starting to flicker from my usual hazel to Apollos&#39; black eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha, I have wolfsbane, lean on me like your stumbling drunk. Chad said through the mind link as he slung one of my arms over his shoulder, he put one arm behind me in the middle of my back as if to support me, and then I felt the tiny prick of the needle as he injected me with wolfsbane to sedate Apollo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolfsbane worked almost instantly as I felt Apollo start to calm down and curl up to sleep in the back of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad and I stumbled out of the house putting on the show that II just had too much to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, human alcohol could never get a werewolf drunk. We have an extremely high tolerance for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have to make our own liquor that has a high enough alcohol percentage. One glass of it would kill a human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We met the four warriors, Greg and Rory, at the Suburban. Everyone piled in and the ride back to the motel was silent. You could cut the tension with a knife as everyone was lost in their own thoughts of what to do next. I could tell that they were too afraid to be the first one to talk, afraid that it might set me off. I couldn&#39;t take the silence any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need a witch,&#34; I stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Chad who spoke up next,&#34;Alpha, we can&#39;t trust the witches. They always have their own agenda, they don&#39;t do anything unless it benefits them in some way. Besides, no werewolf has come in contact with a witch in centuries. We have never gotten along with their kind, they are evil and conniving. They have been in hiding for decades because most wolves kill them almost immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have no other choice, the only way the three of them would have disappeared into thin air like that, is if one of her kidnapers was a witch or warlock. We need a witch to find a witch.&#34; I personally didn&#39;t trust witches either, it&#39;s in our blood not to trust them, but what choice did I have? I would do anything to find Allison, take any risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that I wasn&#39;t backing down from this, Chad nodded, &#34; I can get Gamma Leroy to look through the late Alpha and Luna&#39;s files. Maybe there&#39;s something in there on how to find a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bobbed my head in approval, and with that Chad pulled out his phone and contacted Gamma Leroy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gamma Leroy was another one of mine and Chad&#39;s childhood best friends. We all grew up together, Allison included. As Gamma, it was Leroy&#39;s job to protect the Luna. But since there has been no Luna for the past 3 years, he has spent half his time being on border patrol, always trying to catch a scent of his missing Luna, he spends the other half of his time in the pack library. He was a bit of a book nerd, making him the perfect person for this job. If anyone could find old information quickly, it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We pulled up to the motel and piled out of the vehicle. We opted to get a larger room, seeing as we were extending our stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were given the key to what was supposed to be a bigger room, but instead it was two king-sized beds, and one sofa bed cramped into the same size as the one Greg and Rory had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the exhaustion of the day, I knew I needed some rest if I wanted a clear head to find Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We take shifts, two awake and the rest sleeping, we still don&#39;t know who took her and what kind of threat they pose.&#34; I stated as I got into one of the beds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to let sleep take me, but I couldn&#39;t stop tossing and turning well into the hours of the early morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave up on sleep and let my warriors know I was going for a run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started walking across the parking lot to the forest that was just beyond it. Once at the treeline, I double checked that no humans were around and stripped my clothes, leaving them hidden under some leaves at the base of one of the trees. I started to shift into Apollo, I felt every painful moment of it, given we hadn&#39;t shifted in years. I felt every bone snap and take a new form, I felt my skin tearing apart as it turned into fur, I felt my face break and take the form of a snout, and the large teeth of a wolf push my human form out. I felt claws ripping out of my fingers and toes as they transformed into paws. Once in wolf form, Apollo took off. Feeling free for the first time in years, I was nervous to let him out at first, given how worked up he was earlier, but upon seeing him run through the forest to blow off steam, I understood this was exactly what we both needed. Stopping dead in his tracks, Apollo sniffed the air, curious as to what brought him to a halt. I sniffed too. Then it hit me, lavender and fresh roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MATE HERE! Apollo shouted in my mind. He started racing through the forest following the scent. We came to a clearing that had a small stream leading into a pond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There stood a tall-angelic-like woman., she had long white hair all the way down her back, it looked like it was glowing with power. Her back was facing us, but her aura was that of a goddess. She was floating, I noticed, as I saw her feet hovering graciously off of the ground. She wore a long white-hooded cloak, with a gold floral pattern embroidered along the hem, the cloak ended just before her bare feet. Everything about her screamed Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here, my child,&#34; she said in the most pure voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apollo immediately obeyed and came up to her side, nudging her hand for affection. She then turned to face us and bent down to make us eye-level. She took Apollos&#39; head in both of her hands and held him there for a moment. Her white eyes boring into mine. I felt peace wash over us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I used the smell of your mate to lure you here. Relinquish control back to your human Apollo, I need to speak with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obeying Apollo shifted, unlike earlier, I felt no pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing that I was as naked as the day I was born, I quickly covered my manhood with my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman laughed and flicked her wrist at me. I was immediately clothed in a snug white v-neck shirt, and white sweats to match. My feet were bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you already know the answer to that, my child, I am Selene, the Moon Goddess. I do not have a lot of time, so I will get straight to the point.&#34;, I listened eagerly as she continued, &#34; Allison is in grave danger, you need to get to her as soon as possible, and rescue her. I&#39;m afraid I cannot give you all of the details because it would go against the rules of the gods. I am gifting you with the ability to heal. I have gifted you with peace to rid you of all of your pain. I am gifting you with strength. You will require all of this to rescue her. This all comes with a price. There is a prophecy that Allison will need to fulfill. Trust your instincts, trust Apollo. I must go now child, our time is up. You need to wake up now.&#34; She said as she reached out to touch my forehead, there was a bright light and then it went dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with a jump, my breathing ragged. Taking in my surroundings, I realized I was back in our hotel room. My warriors were staring at me, my jump must have alerted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just a dream?&#34; I whispered to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unknown POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around the room, I was still dressed in the white clothing the Moon Goddess had placed me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that speaking to the Moon Goddess was real, I remembered her words, that Allison was in danger. I had to get to her fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Chad was already awake giving me a quizzical look, probably wondering why I woke up the way I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I uh, spoke to Selene, she visited me in my dream. She gave me gifts. She said we needed to find Allison immediately. She is in danger, whoever or whatever took her, I&#39;m worried they are going to kill her.&#34; I said, worry lacing my tone as I stared at Chad, hoping maybe he knew what to make of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, you should go look in the mirror.&#34; Chad said, still carrying that same look on his face as he pointed to the direction of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about, I just told you we needed to find Allison now, and you want me to go look in the mirror? What is wrong with you man?&#34; I huffed in irritation, climbing out of bed and heading in the direction of the small bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit my head off of the top of the bathroom door frame, &#34;What the hell?&#34; I said, rubbing the spot on my head that I hit. Ducking this time, I went in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To say I was shocked was an understatement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 6&#39;5&#34;, I was already a big guy, but it seemed I was suddenly an easy 7 feet tall. That explains hitting my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body went from being weak and sick looking, to being bigger, bulkier. The white shirt I was wearing was starting to tear where my biceps bulged, my neck, shoulders, back. All muscle. I was so built, I looked intimidating as ever. My skin was no longer pale, but back to the sun-kissed glow it used to be. My hazel eyes were no longer dull. They were full of light, they shone so brilliantly, it was as if they were glowing. My face returned to being chiseled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind felt calm. I was no longer worried about slipping back into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feared nothing. No matter what threat came our way or harmed my mate, I would crush their f*cking skulls with my bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would shed their blood with a smile on my face. This is the Alpha my people deserve. This is the Alpha Allison deserves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ducking out of the bathroom, I asked Chad,&#34;Have you heard from Leroy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned, &#34;Yes Alpha, while you were busy checking yourself out, Leroy called me. He found some information about an old witch. She lives an hour east of here. We could make it there faster if we went as our wolves. He couldn&#39;t find any contact information for her, just a name and her address.&#34; He said, showing me the pin drop on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greg and Rory, we found a witch. Stay here and keep an eye on Allison&#39;s house in case there&#39;s any action there. Keep me updated every hour. Stay hidden I mind linked to Greg and Rory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of you are with me. I mind linked to Chad and my warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked into the forest to be sure nobody could see us. Once certain the coast was clear, we stripped, stuffed our clothes into a bag and shifted. Apollo grabbed the bag of clothes with his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but notice that Apollo was 5x the size. Chad, being of Alpha blood, was normally the same size as me, but not anymore. Apollo towered over his wolf, Troy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only took 25 minutes of running in our wolf form to make it to the witch&#39;s house. Her house was a small stone house in the clearing, with a matching stone chimney coming out of the roof, little clouds of smoke pushing out of it.  It was surrounded by clean cut, green grass and flowers everywhere. It looked like a peaceful home. Still at the edge of the forest, we all shifted back to our human forms and put our clothes on. We walked out of the forest and made our way towards her house. Nearing it, there was a small stone pathway with beds of colourful flowers on either side of it. We followed the path, up her small wooden steps and to the large oak door. I raised my hand to knock, but before I could, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been expecting you. Come in quickly, take a seat on the couch.&#34; Came a soft voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping through the open door, I took in my surroundings. It was small, but cosy. The walls were made of stone, the same as the exterior. The floors were wooden and looked old. There was just one floor. There was a kitchen off to my left with wooden cupboards and countertops. There was a small oven with a white teakettle placed on it. I could hear it boiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my right there was a large brown cloth sectional to take up the space of the living room. With a wooden coffee table placed in front of it. No tv&#39;s or radios, it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like technology, that is why. Messes with my zen.&#34; Came the voice, directly behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whipped around, where did she come from, can she read my mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I can read your mind dummy. The Moon Goddess should have gifted you with some intelligence instead of muscle.&#34; She snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The witch was short and pale. She has white hair and forest green eyes. Her skin was full of wrinkles, but she looked kind and inviting. The way a grandmother would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me young man, weren&#39;t you ever taught some manners? You don&#39;t need to focus on my wrinkles and height. Now I have noticed that there are 6 wolves in my house and not one of you has the courtesy to take your shoes. Were you raised in a barn? Get your shoes off of my floor, I just mopped.&#34; She huffed, waving a finger at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, an Alpha would see this as disrespect, but I found it amusing how this woman just made 6 large intimidating men, whisper apologies as they quickly placed their shoes by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now go and sit, we have lots we need to talk about. I made tea, Chad, please be a dear and pour everyone a glass.&#34; She shooed him away as everyone else took a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you were given gifts by the Goddess herself. Very lucky young man, she must see something in you that I am clearly missing. Manners sure ain&#39;t it. The name is Lena, by the way. Since none of you asked. Before I help you find Allison, you must be prepared for what you will be walking into when you get her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad handed everyone a glass of tea, including Lena, before he took a seat next to me. We all waited in silence, waiting for her to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is a ritual that her captors plan on performing, one that will leave her impregnated with a beast stronger than anything this world has ever seen. They want to use the child to make themselves more powerful. They need Allison specifically for this because there are only two living beings that have the gene capable of carrying this child. I am one of them, Allison is the other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, what do you and Allison have in common that gives you both this gene, I don&#39;t understand?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you that dense boy? I know you noticed the green eyes, I can hear your thoughts. I am her grandmother dummy. The goddess sure could have gifted her someone a little smarter. Anyways, there is lots you must learn, starting with who may be behind this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A:N/ Hey readers, what do you think of the story so far? Unknown character pov is to be revealed soon, I promise it&#39;ll be worth it &lt;3 Next chapter is from Allison&#39;s POV but will be labeled as Grace POV because she still thinks her name is Grace. Also wanted to add a sexual assault trigger warning for the next chapter.</p>
