                <p>The second we get out of here, I want to get a monster cheeseburger or something. I&#39;m starving. Before I go to sleep, can I ask you something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, of course. What is it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How long have we been under Summers&#39; control?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her sigh before answering. She had us drugged most of the time, so I really can&#39;t say for sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s like that whole time is a blur. I truly had no idea how long I had been gone for. Has anyone come looking for me, or did they think I died in the fire? What if no one came for me because they thought I was dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aspen whimpered in my mind at the thoughts I was having.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was glad I had my wolf, it was nice to have some company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, I felt myself drifting off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison! Allison! Wake up, now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aspen was shouting in my mind, groaning. I rubbed my eyes and started to look around, but saw no one. Why was she waking me up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is it Aspen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniff the air, I smell something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started sniffing the air, intrigued by the smell. It was like the woods after a rainfall, with a hint of peppermint. It smelt delicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is that smell Aspen? Where is it coming from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know, I just noticed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, I heard the sound of footsteps. One was the clicking of heels, and the other was heavier, like workboots. Also a dragging sound I couldn&#39;t quite place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell intensified. I got up and ran to the cell door to see who was approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aspen started running around in my mind, yipping. I could see Summer and Dean. But Dean&#39;s back was facing me, he was dragging something. Or someone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they got closer, I could clearly see that it was Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell did you do to him?!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now dear, no need to get your panties in a bunch. I just gave him a little wolfsbane to help him rest. He was trying to save you, it seems, but the big bad Alpha was no match for me.&#34; Summer smirked. She then flicked her wrist and my cell door magically opened. Dean drug Damon in and threw his limp body into my cell. I immediately ran to him worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my goddess Damon, please be okay.&#34; I felt tears welling in my eyes as I went down on my knees next to his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to weaken him and play some mind games, that&#39;s one of my favorite things to do with people. But I haven&#39;t gotten the opportunity to do it to an Alpha before, so this will be a real treat!.&#34; Summer exclaimed as she flicked her wrist again, and her and Dean walked down the hallway and out the steel door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear Damon&#39;s steady heartbeat, I breathed a sigh of relief. He will be okay, he has to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe he risked himself to find me. I decided I just wanted to be close to him when he woke up, so I curled up on the floor next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke to the sound of a groan, and some movement next to me. Sitting up, I looked at Damon, really looked at him this time. F*ck he looked delicious. He was much larger than I remembered. He had on a white vneck t-shirt that looked like it was starting to tear, barely holding his muscles in. It made his sun-kissed skin pop. He had barefeet. He wore white sweatpants that were definitely complimenting his member in ways that made my brain turn to mush. His arms and hands were now covered in tattoos. His lips were full and pink, a lopsided grin playing on them, his jawline strong and defined. Our eyes met, his gorgeous, piercing hazel eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MATE!&#34; we shouted in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well isn&#39;t this a nice turn in events.&#34; Summer sneered,&#34; I figured he might be waking up soon so I thought I would come check, but this was such a pleasant surprise. This could make for some interesting games, I mean you must know by now how much I love games!&#34; she announced as she disapeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon, what&#39;s going on? How long have I been gone for?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon was staring at me, lust filled eyes. I forgot I was still wearing the small pink dress from the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped out of it and met my eyes,&#34;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re okay Allison. There&#39;s a lot you need to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He explained everything to me, the ritual, the gene I possesed. My ancestors, my Grandma I never knew about, the prophecy. He told me it had been 3 years since I had gone missing. He told me about Chad, I remembered Chad being in our friend group growing up. I was shocked beyond words at all of this new information, and sad to hear of Chad&#39;s death, he died trying to find me. I felt utterly guilty. I told him about how Summer played mind tricks with me and placed fake thoughts and memories in my head, like my identity being Grace and Summer being my best friend, the fake sickness and the pills that kept my wolf asleep and how they had made me temproarily lose my memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, I am a hybrid? Where&#39;s my grandma, you said she was here too? If we are mates, why was it that everytime Dean was around I felt drawn to him?&#34; I spitfired questions at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon growled at the last question, &#34;Summer must hace placed a fake mate bond on you and Dean so he could lure you in. She likes playing games, that&#39;s probably why she let you go after all of these years, just so she could toy with you some more. As for your grandma, I don&#39;t know what happened to her, I was drugged before I could get to her. I&#39;m so sorry Allison, that any of this happened to you. If I would have been hooenst from the start and told you about our mate bond, you never would have gone inside the pack house, none of this would have happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, none of this is your fault, she would have gotten me eventually.&#34; I went to lay my head on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instantly felt the sparks, they were magical. It felt warm and safe, happiness bubbled throughout my body. He felt like home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was nothing compared to what I felt with Dean, with Dean it felt like an electric shock, it was never a comforting feeling the way it is with Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me so I was laying on top of him, two big muscled tattooed arms wrapped around my small figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you Allison, I have always loved you. I&#39;ve waited such a long time to tell you that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt butterflies in my stomach at his confession, I have always had feelings for Damon, maybe the mate bond was always there and I didn&#39;t realize it. I lifted my head to meet his gaze, his hazel eyes shining with love, he looked vulernable too. Like he was worried I wouldn&#39;t accept his love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you Damon.&#34; I genuinly meant it to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a breath he must have been holding in while waiting for my answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, get a room you two. Dis-gus-ting!&#34; Summer gagged, she then appeared inside our cell causing us both to jump up, Damon put me behind him and growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the f*ck away from us.&#34; This time it was Apollo who spoke through Damon, wanting to be let out to protect us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh hunny, I&#39;m not here to hurt her just yet. You on the other hand...&#34; She started, before either of us could react Summer appeared beside Damon, I tried to get to him but it&#39;s like I was held in place by invisible chains. Summer cackled as Damon tried moving, also stuck in place it seemed, she then opened her hand and a large needle appeared, full of a grey substance. She took her time making sure that I saw her injecting the liquid into him, I felt helpless. I thrashed against the invisible chains, trying to get to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You b*tch let him go!!!&#34; I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s large body fell to the ground with a thud as the last of the liquid drained from the needle. In an instant, Summer disapeared again and my invisible chains were gone. I ran to Damon and knelt down, holding his head in my hands while I sobbed. I hated feeling so helpess. What was the point of drugging him and leaving again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would make her pay for everything she&#39;s done to us.</p>
