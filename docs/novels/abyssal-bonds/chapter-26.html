                <p>Sophia nodded hesitantly, her clear complexion hardening. The Leviathan had exposed its hand, but they hadn&#39;t finished fighting. But not any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as she peered into the distance, where the seas darkened and the murmurs persisted, she realized the true battle was still ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fires of Betrayal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The palace became eerily quiet. Aquaria had fallen into silence since the final battle, yet worry boiled beneath the floor, ready to boil over. Sophia sat in the war room, her thoughts repeating the battle over and over. The Leviathan&#39;s murmurs lingered like ghosts, making her mistrust each move and syllable. She looked around the desk where Tharros sat, his golden eyes filled with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael entered, his armor still scuffed from the fight. &#34;Patrols have returned. The outer trenches show no signs of movement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too quiet,&#34; Tharros said, his voice low. &#34;The Leviathan is not retreating. It is plotting something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded. &#34;And we&#39;re not prepared for it.&#34; Her gaze shifted to Arin, who stood by the window, peering into the black waters beyond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could answer, the doors sprang open. Kyras strode in, his face grim. &#34;we&#39;ve a trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council room became filled with anxiety. Aquaria&#39;s leaders, once strong in their unity, now exchanged anxious glances. Kyras stood in the center, commanding attention despite the council members&#39; apprehensive gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Leviathan&#39;s have an impact on runs deeper than we thought,&#34; started Kyras. &#34;There&#39;s a traitor amongst you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted in murmurs, and incredulity spread like wildfire. Tharros climbed to his feet, his mysterious demeanor tinged with slightly suppressed rage. &#34;That&#39;s an extreme accusation, Kyras.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it&#39;s authentic,&#34; Kyras said, shooting lower back. &#34;One of your personnel has been passing information to the Leviathan&#39;s emissaries. That&#39;s how they&#39;ve remained one step ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach twisted. She examined the faces in the room, looking for any signs of guilt. &#34;Do you have proof?&#34; she asked, her voice steady despite the tumult within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kyras hesitated and then nodded. &#34;enough to recognize who it&#39;s far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A painful quiet descended over the gathering as Kyras became one of the council contributors. Councilor Lyran, a thin person with sharp features and an air of conceit, had always been outspoken, frequently disagreeing with Tharros on matters of strategy. Lyran&#39;s expression clouded as the charge hovered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s absurd,&#34; Lyran said, rising from his seat. &#34;you are taking the word of an outsider over a devoted servant of Aquaria?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loyalty is meaningless if it&#39;s poisoned by greed,&#34; Tharros hissed. &#34;if you&#39;ve betrayed us, I&#39;ll know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia experienced a surge of willpower. She closed her eyes and acted with the strength she only partially understood but could not deny. The murmurs she had once feared became threads she would wish to follow, bringing her to truths buried beneath layers of lies. As she opened her eyes, they gleamed slightly, and her voice became uncompromising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyran, display us your palms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyran&#39;s expression faltered, and a worried look crossed his face. &#34;This is outrageous.&#34; You can&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now,&#34; Sophia demanded, her voice resonating with authority that silenced the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyran reluctantly raised his hands. A small, sickening glow flashed from his fingertips, indicating the Leviathan&#39;s impact. Gasps echoed across the chamber, and Lyran&#39;s defiance shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no desire,&#34; he screamed, his voice shaking. &#34;The Leviathan&#39;s power is total. It promised me protection-for my own family and my people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you endangered all of Aquaria during the procedure,&#34; Tharros yelled, his charm flashing. &#34;You&#39;ve condemned countless lives together with your cowardice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyran dropped to his knees, his equanimity shaken. &#34;I did not advise that it be moved a large distance. &#34;Please forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council adjourned in disarray, the discovery creating a scar that would be impossible to mend. Lyran was hauled into custody, but the damage had already been done. Sophia joined Tharros to the balcony, which overlooked the town. The brilliance of Aquaria&#39;s coral networks appeared muted, as if the betrayal had contaminated even the water itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my fault,&#34; Tharros said, his voice full of guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia placed a hand on his arm. &#34;you may&#39;t blame your self for someone else&#39;s choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros shakes his head. &#34;I should&#39;ve seen it. Lyran&#39;s goal has always presented an opportunity. &#34;I let my satisfaction blind me to the dangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You relied on him,&#34; Sophia said softly. &#34;That&#39;s now not a weak spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s far while it charges lives,&#34; Tharros said, his expression darkening. &#34;The Leviathan didn&#39;t stop here. It&#39;s the use of worry to tear us apart, and it&#39;s working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s solution deepened. &#34;Then we combat lower back. together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As night settled over Aquaria, the metropolis tried to catch its breath. Sophia worked late into the night, honing her tool and prepared for the conflicts to resume. Kael joined her, providing soothing solidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to rest,&#34; he said, watching her adjust the crystalline components.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t,&#34; she replied, without looking up. &#34;not even as the Leviathan is out there, expecting us to slip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael placed a hand on her shoulder and spoke softly. &#34;We receive nowadays. It&#39;s okay to take a moment to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia finally glanced at him, her eyes tired out yet resolute. &#34;If we prevent, even for a 2d, we may not get any other threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael sighed, but didn&#39;t protest. He stayed by her side, like a quiet father or mother, as she worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning brought a new nightmare. The skies over Aquaria, once colorful and teaming with sunlight, were now clouded in an ominous darkness. The waters felt thicker and chillier, as if the Leviathan&#39;s presence had permeated the present day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin dashed into the battle room, her expression fading. &#34;It&#39;s began.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia joined her at the window, her heart sinking from the sight. The shadow of the Leviathan loomed over the village, its form scarcely visible but unmistakable. The murmurs in her mind were stronger and more urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can&#39;t stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros entered with a sad expression. &#34;It&#39;s trying us out again. However, this time, it will not take long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned to face him, her voice firm despite the concern she was feeling. &#34;Then neither do we.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council&#39;s condition improved after they regrouped. The Leviathan&#39;s shadow became more than just a possibility; it was a promise of catastrophe. And unless they act decisively, Aquaria may fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, beneath the terror, a spark of wish lingered. Sophia felt it in her comrades&#39; determination, within the oneness that betrayal had not fractured. The Leviathan had underestimated them previously. It would not make that mistake again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia made a secret promise as the shadows clouded the skies. They might not go into this conflict unprepared. The fires of betrayal had tested them, but they would come out stronger-or die trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The First Breach</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darkness that enveloped Aquaria&#39;s skies pushed down on its people, a constant reminder of the Leviathan&#39;s impending danger. The metropolis&#39; previously vibrant coral networks faded beneath the crushing gloom, their brilliance flickering like frail candles in a typhoon. Sophia stood at the edge of the war room&#39;s balcony, hands clinched, staring into the abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time,&#34; Tharros remarked as he stepped beside her. His voice was calm, but it had the weight of a ruler who had witnessed far too many conflicts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael entered the chamber, his trident shimmering slightly against the light. &#34;Scouts record movement from the western trench. It is heading straight for the metropolis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin joined them, her magic crackling softly around her fingertips. &#34;This is not a test.&#34; &#34;The Leviathan is making its move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grew to be able to withstand them, and her resolve strengthened. &#34;Then we face it head-on. &#34;We will not let Aquaria fall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarms rang throughout the town, creating a haunting rhythm of urgency. Warriors took up positions along the outer walls, their weapons shimmering faintly with enchantments intended to fight the Leviathan&#39;s corrupted energies. The waters churned as if in anticipation, with the currents agitated and unpredictable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was at the front, alongside Tharros, Kael, and Arin. Kyras, the Shark clan emissary, surrounded them, his demeanor gloomy but resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s starting,&#34; Kael said, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The primary wave struck without notice. Twisted sea creatures, their bureaucracy hideous and unnatural, charged against the city&#39;s walls. The soldiers controlled the route, their strikes precise and unwavering. However, for every species they killed, more were expected to take its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart raced as she concentrated her hydrokinesis, creating powerful currents that pushed the creatures back. Arin&#39;s spells shimmered like a shielding dome, repelling attacks and providing their warriors with brief respites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros unleashed his dragon hearth, a scorching burst of heat that ripped through the enemy lines. Kael fought beside him, his trident a blur as he dispatched any thing that came too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re now not stopping,&#34; Kyras muttered, his blade slicing through a serpent-like beast. &#34;We want to push them again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s instrument, the one she had worked so hard to perfect, pulsed faintly on her wrist. She ignited it, sending a shockwave through the sea. The creatures stumbled, their actions irregular, as their relationship with the Leviathan shifted briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now!&#34; She shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warriors moved forward, pressing their advantage. For a brief while, it appeared that they might keep the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the Leviathan acknowledged its presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water became chillier and darker as a massive shadow passed across the depths. Its voice repeated in Sophia&#39;s mind, a haunting murmur that sent shivers down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did you think you could stop me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s messengers, more larger and more powerful than the corrupted creatures, emerged from the darkness. Towering beings with dazzling eyes and jagged weaponry moved with horrifying accuracy, slicing through Aquaria&#39;s fortifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s pulse accelerated as one of the emissaries charged at her. She raised her fingers, unleashing a torrent of water that smacked into the thing, but it faltered somewhat. Kael intercepted it, his trident colliding with its blade in a shower of sparks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re losing ground,&#34; Arin said, her voice straining as she cast another spell to protect the men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s gaze moved to Tharros, who was fighting with another emissary. His dragon charisma flashed, yet his great power appeared only enough to keep his opponent at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want more electricity,&#34; Sophia whispered, the certainty settling deeply in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation drove her forward. She moved away from the others, her mind racing. The whispers in her thoughts became stronger, encouraging and teasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You already have access to electricity. Use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes and went deep within herself. She could feel the power strands connecting her to Aquaria, the Leviathan, and something larger. It turned into a risky venture, but she had no alternative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opened her eyes, they shone with an extraordinary, unearthly gentleness. The water around her was alive with energy, spreading outward in waves that made even the Leviathan&#39;s emissaries pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, what are you doing?&#34; Kael&#39;s voice became filled with alarm, but she couldn&#39;t find a solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her arms, and the water responded. A massive whirlpool formed, drawing the emissaries toward its center. The sheer strain of it became astounding, and for a brief moment, it appeared that she may turn the tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the excitement was tremendous. Sophia&#39;s body trembled as the lightning rushed through her, threatening to consume her. She should pay attention to the Leviathan&#39;s frigid, mocking laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You couldn&#39;t control it. You will harm yourself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, stop!&#34; Tharros shouted, his voice cutting through the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she was unable to stop. The power had seized control and ordered a launch. With a final shout, she unleashed a barrage of electricity that ripped through the battlefield, annihilating the emissaries and driving the Leviathan&#39;s warriors into retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seas stilled, and the war was won. However, the silence that followed became deafening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia slumped, her imaginative and clairvoyant abilities dimming as tiredness overwhelmed her. When she awoke, she was in the palace, surrounded by her partners. Their features were carved with the circumstance, but also with something else: worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What passed off?&#34; She inquired, her tone just above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s expression was bleak. &#34;You stored us. but...&#34; He hesitated, looking at Tharros.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;however what?&#34; Sophia pressed, creating a knot in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin spoke quietly, her tone guarded. &#34;The electricity you utilized was not solely your own. It was historical and perilous. Even the Leviathan seemed afraid of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s coronary heart dropped. She gazed at Tharros, whose golden eyes were filled with a mixture of thankfulness and anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will figure it out,&#34; he said firmly. &#34;collectively.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Sophia was unsure. The recollection of the energy persisted, a dark and enticing pressure that threatened to engulf her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as she looked out the window at the Leviathan&#39;s shadow still looming over the city, she realized the conflict was far from ended. If anything, it had most likely just started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fractured Awakening</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frigid ripple drew Sophia from the depths of her unconsciousness. Her eyelids flickered open, and her physique felt strange and flimsy, as if her limbs had been replaced with brittle coral. The ceiling above her shimmered gently, lit by bioluminescent lighting fixtures that moved like cautious fireflies. She changed into lower back at Aquaria&#39;s palace, but the weight in her chest warned her that everything had altered drastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia,&#34; Tharros&#39; deep voice rumbled, a combination of warmth and reserved difficulty. He sat at her bedside, his powerful presence softened by worry. His bright eyes scanned her face for indications of popularity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tharros,&#34; she said softly, her voice scarcely audible. It felt like sand was scraping through her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say anything else, Arin looked around, her delicate hands shimmering with gentle, green magic. Kael trailed behind her, his trident draped across his back, his visage dismal yet hopeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You gave us quite the scare,&#34; Arin murmured, kneeling beside her. &#34;stay still; you&#39;ve been via greater than your body can deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes, flashbacks of the struggle flashing through her mind. The Leviathan&#39;s resounding laughter. The burning flash of power that had erupted from her core, tearing through both friend and foe alike. Then comes darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What came about?&#34; Her voice broke, the question tinted with guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saved Aquaria,&#34; Tharros replied, but his tone included an unspoken caveat. &#34;however the electricity you wielded-it almost ate up you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shuddered. She remembered the draw of historical power, how intoxicating it had been, and how much it had worried her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is every person... secure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael moved closer, his voice quiet yet firm. &#34;You grew to become the tide of the struggle, but the Leviathan retreated. Its corruption is spreading over other kingdoms. We held the line, but the combat is far from over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s power swept across Sophia&#39;s chest, calming her strained anxieties. &#34;You cannot bear this burden by yourself. That electricity-you weren&#39;t allowed to transport it without steering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s coronary heart twisted. The Leviathan&#39;s voice rang in her memory, a disturbing reminder of how close she&#39;d been to killing herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You will never have control over it. It will take control of you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers trembled as she clutched the bed&#39;s barrier. &#34;What if I hurt someone next time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t receive it,&#34; Tharros replied firmly, giving up hers. &#34;No longer, even though we are right here. We will assist you. collectively.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The earnestness in his voice grounded her. She looked at Kael, who gave her a curt nod, then Arin, whose enigmatic smile disguised her own anxieties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia wanted to believe what they said, but the darkness at the edge of her recognition shouted differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The periods observed were demanding. Sophia&#39;s recovery was slow, as her body suffered from the strain of channeling such colossal force. Tharros often remained by her side, offering modest words of encouragement. Kael pushed her to restore her physical energy, his drills brutal but necessary. Arin concentrated on calming the magic within her, teaching her strategies for suppressing surges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their attempts, Sophia became increasingly uneasy. The Leviathan&#39;s voice had gone mute during the conflict, but its presence lingered in her desires. Every night, she saw darkness swallow Aquaria and heard the laments of its inhabitants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped up to the balcony one night while the palace was sleeping. The sea stretched on indefinitely before her, its calm surface belying the fury beneath. She closed her eyes in search of peace in the silence, but the memories refused to let her rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be out here alone,&#34; Tharros murmured, stepping into view. His gaze lingered on her faded features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t sleep,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He joined her, the silence between them filled with unsaid anxieties. &#34;You are stronger than you realize, Sophia. However, strength does not imply facing everything alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him, searching his face for the truth behind his words. &#34;What if I can&#39;t do it next time? What if I become the monster I&#39;m attempting to defeat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; expression stiffened. &#34;You won&#39;t, since you are no longer alone in this. &#34;Consider us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia wanted to. She needed to. However, doubt gnawed at her resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days progressed into weeks. Sophia pushed herself harder, determined to master her abilities. The Leviathan&#39;s retreat had provided Aquaria with a reprieve, but everyone knew it would only be brief. Scouts reported encounters with corrupted beasts near neighboring kingdoms. The council became restless, and rumors of discontent spread like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt energy surge throughout her one afternoon while attending an education session with Kael. It grew without care, a tidal wave of electricity threatening to overflow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;focus!&#34; Kael barked, grasping her shoulders. &#34;Control it.&#34; &#34;Do not let it control you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clenched her fists, her breathing harsh. She imagined the faces of the people she struggled to protect, and the friends who believed in her. Slowly, the surge subsided, leaving her depleted yet constant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Properly,&#34; Kael said, his voice quieter. &#34;You&#39;re getting there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, despite feeling exhausted. Each step forward felt like a battle in itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, as she napped, Arin went to her chamber. The theme helped to soften the ocean witch&#39;s usually harsh temperament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something you should see,&#34; Arin said, guiding Sophia to her tower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The area became filled with luminous orbs, each revealing a vision of the Leviathan&#39;s corruption spreading throughout the waters. A once-thriving town lay in ruins, its inhabitants fueled by insanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is what we&#39;re up against,&#34; Arin said, her voice quiet. &#34;but there&#39;s something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved her hand, and a historical text appeared in the air. The words shone dimly, written in a language Sophia recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a prophecy,&#34; Arin explained. &#34;It speaks of a person who can wield the powers of dragon, merfolk, and sea witch to either save or ruin Aquaria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s blood was bloodless. &#34;you suspect that&#39;s me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded. &#34;The signs and symptoms affect you. However, the prophecy is unclear on your position. It may go both ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia focused on the written material, the weight of the future crushing down on her. &#34;What if I fail?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s gaze softened. &#34;Then we will pick you up. Sophia, you&#39;re not doing this alone anymore. &#34;I understand that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned to her chamber as the night became darker, her mind racing with thoughts of the prophecy. Sleep evaded her, and the shadows seemed to murmur her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a cold breeze blew through the room. The lights darkened, and the Leviathan&#39;s voice resonated in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do you think you have control over the power? It will wreck you. And when it does, I&#39;ll be prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gasped, her heart racing. The room fell silent again, but the Leviathan&#39;s words lingered, a terrible reminder of the struggle that was still to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the first time, she wondered if she truly had the strength to face it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan’s Retreat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frightening silence following Sophia&#39;s encounter with the Leviathan did not last long. The royal corridors quickly filled with frantic footfall, hurried murmurs, and the echo of urgent orders. Scouts returned with news that should have brought hope, but instead increased the anxiety that had settled over Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia sat in a niche of the council chamber, her fingers delicately caressing the smooth armrest of the coral-crafted chair. The words of the Leviathan rang in her memory, a mocking reminder that its retreat was anything but a surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ve fallen back,&#34; Kael announced, standing before of the assembled commanders. His speech grew more constant, but the tightness in his jaw indicated his irritation. &#34;But it&#39;s not over. The Leviathan is reorganizing, spreading corruption throughout the outer kingdoms. We cannot mistake this for victory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs spread around the room. The senior council members exchanged apprehensive glances, while others openly murmured amongst themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked up at Tharros, who stood motionless at the top of the hall. His golden eyes scanned the gathering, his presence imposing despite the growing conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael continued to pace, barely moving. &#34;Scouts reported sightings of corrupted marine creatures beyond the Coral Expanse. Previously thriving villages are now cloaked in gloom. &#34;If we do not act-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A harsh voice interrupted him. &#34;And whose fault is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia froze when Elder Varyon, the Shark Clans&#39; senior representative, stood. His gaze pierced the room like a blade, landing solidly on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This human,&#34; he spat, moving closer to Sophia, &#34;brought her turmoil to Aquaria. And now the Leviathan is aware of our location and is focused on our technique buddies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s breath caught. The room burst into a cacophony of voices. Some echoed Varyon&#39;s view, but others rallied to her defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;enough!&#34; Tharros&#39; words rang out, silencing the room. His look became intense. &#34;We&#39;re not here to point fingers, but to strategize. Elder Varyon, when you have answers, speak them. If not, sit down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elder&#39;s lips thinned, but he returned to his seat, his dissatisfaction clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia swallowed the lump in her throat, her fists holding the armrest firmly. She wanted to speak, to protect herself, but her voice felt crushed beneath the weight of their stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin, sitting beside her, leaned in and said, &#34;Let them argue.&#34; Their words cannot replace the reality of what you&#39;ve done for Aquaria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sophia was not so optimistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting dragged on, with each report revealing more sad information. Coral cities in the western territories were succumbing to the Leviathan&#39;s impact. When the colourful bioluminescent reefs darkened, their electricity ran out. Whole populations had left, while others had disappeared entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want to act,&#34; Kael stated firmly, putting his fingers on the table. &#34;waiting will handiest support the Leviathan&#39;s grip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And weaken ours,&#34; another council member countered. &#34;If we flow our forces, Aquaria might be left inclined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia finally found her voice. &#34;If we do nothing, we&#39;re susceptible anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes grew to focus on her. She forced herself to look up, despite the fact that her legs felt unsteady under her. &#34;The Leviathan is not retiring; it is shifting. It is spreading its corruption, causing turmoil and dividing us. If we don&#39;t band together and fight until the end, we&#39;ll lose everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words floated in the air.</p>
