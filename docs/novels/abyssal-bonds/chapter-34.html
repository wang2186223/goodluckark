                <p>Kael looked up, meeting Tharros&#39; eyes. &#34;What if I fail? What if this this divide tears us apart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; face softened, his voice steady. &#34;Then you fight harder. You tell them why they follow you. And you don&#39;t let the ones who fail you define the ones who stay loyal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded, the weight in his chest easing slightly. Tharros&#39; words didn&#39;t remove the pain of Jarek&#39;s betrayal, but they gave him a sliver of hope. He would fight for Aquaria, for its people, for its future. No matter the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he sat in the quiet of the room, a lingering unease settled over him. Jarek had spoken of others. How deep did this deception run? And how long before it turned into something far worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unity or Division</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vast council chamber of Aquaria was filled with tension. The space, carved from shimmering coral and lighted by beautiful bioluminescent lamps, felt as if it would collapse beneath the weight of the internal conflict. Voices merged in a wild symphony of rage, terror, and defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia waited in the shadows, watching the sight with a knot in her stomach. The strain was not new, but today it seemed insurmountable. This was more than just a dispute; it was a war for the soul of Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stood at the head of the long, twisting table, his golden eyes scanning the council members. He emanated power, like a monarch whose authority required respect. Despite his powerful presence, he was unable to bring the chaos under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Shark Clans are our allies now,&#34; Tharros remarked, his voice piercing through the din like a razor. &#34;They bled for Aquaria.&#34; They have stood with us against threats that could have devastated us all. Turning them away now is not just ungrateful, but also hazardous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Councillor Tormek, the Coral Clan elder, stood from his seat, his face a mask of rage. &#34;Dangerous?&#34; he spit. &#34;Do you believe the true danger is in rejecting them? Have you forgotten the blood spilled during the wars? How many lives were lost as a result of their savagery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough, Tormek,&#34; Tharros muttered, his tone harsh enough to drown out the muttering that followed the elder&#39;s comments. &#34;The past cannot define the future. We must stick together if we are to withstand what is ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went hushed for a heartbeat before erupting into mayhem again. The dispute erupted, with charges and counterarguments flying like arrows across a battlefield. Sophia&#39;s pulse was racing as she watched, torn between rage and grief. These so-called leaders were ripping one other apart, while the genuine menace got closer with each passing instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael approached her, his voice low and strained. &#34;They aren&#39;t going to listen.&#34; &#34;This is going to split the council.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia tightened her fists at her side. She had spent weeks researching Aquarian customs, discovering their ideals and worries. She&#39;d seen hints of the prophesy that tied her to Tharros, Kael, and Arin, but nothing prepared her for this. The weight of the kingdom&#39;s destiny weighed heavily on her, and she knew she couldn&#39;t remain silent any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and went forward, her heels quietly clicking on the stone floor. &#34;Enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice, calm yet commanding, cut through the chaos. Heads turned to face her, their eyes narrowing with doubt, curiosity, and, in some cases, disdain. She felt their judgment like a physical weight on her shoulders, yet she stood erect and met their gazes with unwavering determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand your fears,&#34; she said, her voice firm. &#34;I have heard stories of battle and betrayal. I understand the scars the Shark Clans have left on your history. But clinging onto that anguish and allowing it influence your behavior now can only lead to our demise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Councillor Tormek&#39;s sneer intensified. &#34;And what do you know about our history, surface dweller?&#34; You&#39;ve only been here a few months, and you dare to lecture us about our traditions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned to him, her expression resolute. &#34;I may not have experienced your conflicts, Councillor, but I have studied them. I understand how animosity and dread tore apart the Abyssal Tribes. They clung to old wounds, paying the price with blood. &#34;Is that the legacy you want for Aquaria?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur sounded around the room. Some council members exchanged nervous glances, their resolve faltering. Sophia pressed on, her voice rising in conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Leviathan stirs in the deep,&#34; she added. &#34;We&#39;ve all seen the signs: shadows in the trenches, creatures abandoning their homes. This is not a threat we can face separately. The prophecy speaks of unification, with all clans standing together. If we do not answer that call, we will doom ourselves and our future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room became silent as the weight of her remarks hung over the council like a storm cloud. Sophia&#39;s heart pounded in her chest, but she maintained a steady demeanor and fixed her attention on Tormek. The elder&#39;s expression was one of fierce resistance, but there was a spark of uncertainty in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ask us to trust the Shark Clans,&#34; he added after a time, his voice softer but still firm. &#34;I trust you. However, trust must be earned rather than commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her voice softening. &#34;You&#39;re correct. Trust is earned. And the Shark Clans deserve it. They fought and sacrificed for Aquaria. They demonstrated their allegiance even when they had every reason to leave. If we can&#39;t see that, we&#39;ve failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tormek paused, his hands gripping the edge of the table. For a brief moment, it appeared that he would relent. But then his face tightened and he shook his head. &#34;I will not stand by and let our traditions be trampled. If you insist on taking this route, you will do it without my support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up from his seat and marched toward the chamber doors. Other conservative members followed him one by one, their departure serving as a harsh reminder of the difference they faced. Sophia&#39;s chest squeezed as she watched them leave, the sting of failure threatening to overcome her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, a voice cut through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned to see Councillor Lyra of the Dolphin Clan there, her face determined. &#34;I may not agree with everything, but I will not abandon our people in this time of need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her statement caused a rippling effect. Other councillors, buoyed by her speech, expressed their support, their desire for togetherness outweighing their fear. The tide slowly began to shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved forward, his gaze sweeping across the remaining council members. &#34;This is our chance to prove that Aquaria is stronger together,&#34; he told reporters. &#34;That we may overcome our differences and face the future together. &#34;Let&#39;s not waste it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell into an unsettling stillness, the weight of their decision hanging in the air. Sophia sighed, relieved yet with residual tightness. They had won the fight, but the war wasn&#39;t done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the council began to disperse and mumble among themselves, Tharros looked to Sophia. His golden eyes were full of thanks and something deeper, unspoken. &#34;Thank you,&#34; he replied softly. &#34;Your words may have saved us today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia mustered a faint smile, but her mind was already racing ahead. &#34;We&#39;re not finished yet.&#34; &#34;There is still the Leviathan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; expression clouded. He looked out the crystalline windows that ringed the chamber, beyond which the dark waters of Aquaria stretched indefinitely. A large and gloomy shadow moved there, serving as a quiet warning of the impending fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s closer than we thought,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia followed his gaze, her chest constricting as the shadow grew larger, its shape scarcely discernible but undeniably monstrous. The Leviathan, an ancient and relentless force of nature, loomed on the horizon, her approach foreshadowing the difficulties that lay ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baptism in the Sacred Pools</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s shadow stayed in Sophia&#39;s consciousness long after the council chamber was empty. The meeting&#39;s tension had not completely left her chest, but she didn&#39;t have time to linger on it. Tharros&#39; deep, steady voice shattered the silence as they proceeded along the coral-lit halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must undergo the Rite of the Sacred Pools,&#34; said the priest. &#34;It&#39;s the only way to awaken your full potential before the Leviathan strikes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia paused in her tracks, her pulse racing. She had heard murmurs about the ancient and unpredictable power of the pools. &#34;What does it involve?&#34; she said, her voice firm despite the unease that was creeping into her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros turned to face her, his golden gaze penetrating yet calm. &#34;It isn&#39;t merely a ritual. It is a trial. The pools tell who you are and who you are destined to become. They reveal what&#39;s buried within you-but only if you&#39;re willing to confront it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s voice joined them, providing a reassuring anchor in the gathering storm. &#34;We&#39;ll be there with you,&#34; he murmured, his bluegreen stare unwavering. &#34;Every step of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin lingered on the outskirts of the conversation, her enigmatic presence as unsettling as it was captivating. &#34;The pools don&#39;t lie,&#34; she whispered. &#34;They will reveal facts you have ignored, Sophia. &#34;Can you handle that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned her gaze, the challenge igniting something stubborn inside her. &#34;I don&#39;t have a choice, do I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s lips formed a faint smile, more shadow than warmth. &#34;Not if you want to survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the Sacred Pools was both breathtaking and intimidating. They plunged into the depths of Aquaria, the water becoming colder and darker with each passing moment. The city&#39;s bioluminescent glow faded behind them, leaving a profound silence that felt like the ocean was holding its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pools are located within a grotto formed by time and magic. Luminescent crystal veins surged throughout the walls, creating shifting patterns of light on the motionless, dark waters. Sophia felt a shudder run down her spine as she approached. The air, or rather the water around her, looked alive, vibrating with an old force that resonated deep inside her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros placed a hand on her shoulder to ground her. &#34;The pools will put your willpower and heart to the test.&#34; &#34;Remember, you are not alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stood at her left, his presence strong and trustworthy. &#34;Trust yourself,&#34; he replied simply. &#34;You&#39;ve come this far for a reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin was the last to speak, her voice a quiet whisper with a hint of warning. &#34;Let go of what you believe you know. The pools require honesty. Anything less, and they&#39;ll devour you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gulped hard and then nodded. She took a step forward, her foot sliding into the soft, silty floor as she approached the edge of the largest pool. The sea sparkled with iridescent light, enticing and menacing all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens now?&#34; She inquired, her voice hardly more than a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros responded, his tone solemn. &#34;You enter. &#34;And you let the pools lead you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s surroundings changed as soon as she walked into the water. The icy liquid engulfed her, but it wasn&#39;t the chill that stopped her breathing. It was a burst of energy, a force so powerful and primal that it felt like it could tear her apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyesight clouded, and the cavern transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes. She felt herself sinking, with no sensation of up or down. Voices rang in her head, pieces of thoughts and memories she couldn&#39;t recognize. They swirled around her, overwhelming and confusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Focus,&#34; said Tharros, his voice distant yet distinct. &#34;Find your center.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes, forced herself to take steady breaths amidst the noise. The noise faded gradually, giving way to a steady pulse that matched her heart&#39;s rhythm. She opened her eyes to see herself standing in a great expanse of water, its surface reaching endlessly in all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where am I?&#34; She whispered, but no one was there to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure rose from the sea, its shape altering and shimmering like liquid light. It was both familiar and exotic, a reflection of herself and something completely other. The figure&#39;s eyes shone with an inner fire, commanding and unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Sophia inquired, her voice quivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creature tilted its head, a small smile spreading over its lips. &#34;I am what you fear. What you are denying. &#34;What you could become.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s breath caught. The comments slashed through her like a razor, exposing weaknesses she thought she&#39;d buried. &#34;I&#39;m not afraid,&#34; she responded, but the quaver in her voice betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure moved closer, its eyes penetrating. &#34;Then prove it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the cavern, the water around Sophia started to churn. Tharros, Kael, and Arin watched in tense quiet as currents swirled, creating intricate patterns that appeared both chaotic and intentional. The crystals on the walls pulsed in sync with the movements, throwing eerie shadows across the cavern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s struggling,&#34; Kael explained, his fists curled at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39;s expression was bleak. &#34;She must confront it alone. &#34;Intervening would only make matters worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes narrowed, her concentration unwavering. &#34;She will survive. &#34;She has to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s confrontation with the figure peaked in the pool&#39;s depths. It lunged at her, its form disintegrating into a torrent of water that slammed into her with unwavering intensity. She strained to stay upright and breathe, but the pressure was too intense. She felt herself descending, plunging into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A recollection arose unexpectedly and vividly. It was the day she first stepped foot in Aquaria, the awe and dread she felt as she was plunged into an unfamiliar environment. She recalled Tharros&#39; piercing glance, Kael&#39;s firm presence, and Arin&#39;s enigmatic smile. They had been her moorings, her motivation to battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re stronger than this,&#34; she said to herself, the words a lifeline in the darkness. &#34;I&#39;m stronger than this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blackness began to fade, replaced by a bright light. Sophia felt a burst of power unlike anything she had ever experienced. It rushed through her veins, sparking every nerve ending with a scorching fury. She opened her eyes to find herself back in the cavern, the water surrounding her gleaming with iridescent beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her hand, and the currents responded. They twisted and flowed precisely, according to her every idea. Sophia&#39;s chest heaved as she took in the scene, the understanding of who she had become setting in like a second skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros walked forward, his face a mix of pride and relief. &#34;You did it,&#34; he stated softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s palm touched hers, anchoring her as the tremendous energy threatened to swallow her. &#34;We&#39;re with you,&#34; he stated. &#34;Always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin stood a few paces away, her eyes unreadable. &#34;The power is yours now,&#34; she replied. &#34;But power is a two-edged sword. Use it carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, but her mind had already turned to the shadow that loomed outside the cave. The Leviathan was closer than ever, and she knew the struggle would require everything she had gained-and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they exited the Sacred Pools, the faint glimmer of the crystals faded, leaving the cavern in darkness. Sophia looked back, a shiver racing down her spine. The pools had given her strength, but they also provided glimpses of what lied ahead. The Leviathan&#39;s shadow loomed huge in her mind, a foreshadowing of the challenges to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re ready,&#34; Tharros stated, his voice firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned his stare, her determination stiffening. &#34;We have to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when they returned to the city, a distant roar rang through the depths, shaking Aquaria to its very core. Sophia&#39;s breath seized and her heart raced as the cacophony faded into an unsettling silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan was no longer waiting. It was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fractures of Trust</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stood on the edge of the council chamber balcony, the huge underwater city of Aquaria sparkling underneath. However, the city&#39;s bioluminescent brilliance did little to lift the darkness in his head. The parchment in his fingers felt heavier than it should, its words tearing at his trust like jagged coral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A name. Not just any name, but one from his inner circle-someone he&#39;d fought beside and trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; voice sliced through the tension, forceful yet strained. &#34;Kael, you have been restless since the pools. &#34;What is on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael turned with his jaw gritted. &#34;I found something. &#34;A list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; golden eyes narrowed, and his presence became formidable. &#34;A list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael hesitated, aware that once the words left his mouth, there was no turning back. &#34;It implicates several high-ranking officials. &#34;There are traitors in our ranks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hush that followed was stifling, with its weight pushing down like crushing depths. Sophia, sitting near the luminous map of Aquaria, straightened. &#34;Traitors? Are you certain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael handed Tharros the parchment, which he examined, his expression deepening with each passing second. &#34;This This affects everything,&#34; Tharros said quietly, his tone unreadable. &#34;If this is true, we&#39;re compromised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia leaned forwards, her words fervent. &#34;What do we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s fist squeezed at his side. &#34;We act. Now. &#34;Expose them before they can cause further damage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros shook his head, his calm manner contrasted strongly with Kael&#39;s rage. &#34;If we move too soon and they&#39;re not alone in this, we risk exposing our knowledge and losing the chance to uproot the entire conspiracy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s rage flared. &#34;Would you risk everything to play the waiting game?&#34; &#34;Tharros, this isn&#39;t strategy; it&#39;s recklessness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between them crackled with tension. Sophia stepped in, her calm but firm voice providing a steadying presence. &#34;Stop. Both of you. &#34;We need a plan that strikes a balance between caution and urgency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s glare softened as it fell on her, but his rage lingered beneath the surface. &#34;I can&#39;t stand by while we&#39;re being betrayed from within.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39;s reaction was shortened. &#34;And I won&#39;t gamble the lives of our people on halfformed evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia interjected again, her voice sharper this time. &#34;Enough. &#34;If we are divided, we have already lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin entered the room, her face unreadable but her presence electrifying. &#34;It appears that the cracks in our unity are beginning to show,&#34; she continued, her tone somewhat amused. &#34;This won&#39;t end well if we don&#39;t address it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia frowned. &#34;You have a suggestion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin shrugged, her eyes wandering over the anxious group. &#34;Trust is like glass-easily broken. But sometimes you have to smash it to discover what&#39;s underneath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros exhaled heavily. &#34;What do you propose, Arin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips formed a mysterious smile. &#34;Let the traitors believe they&#39;ve won. Lay a trap. But be careful; the water is murky, and the currents will draw you under if you don&#39;t stay attentive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael bristled. &#34;And if they strike first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s smile grew, becoming colder. &#34;Then we make sure they regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days after were stressful. Kael poured himself into his task, every move deliberate yet driven by rage. His dealings with Tharros became colder, and their once flawless cooperation frayed at the edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia regarded the two men warily, feeling the weight of their dissatisfaction permeate into her own heart. The strain was evident, and the sense of oneness they had worked so hard to establish was now on the verge of disintegration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, rumours of unrest spread across Aquaria. The Shark Clans, ever vigilant and unpredictable, began to express their doubts. Their leader, Lord Tyros, was the first to publicly criticize Aquaria&#39;s leadership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your kingdom is losing its grip,&#34; Tyros hissed during a tense meeting. &#34;If you cannot protect your own walls, how do you expect to protect the alliance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros returned his gaze with a calm that belied the tempest rising inside him. &#34;Aquaria has existed for centuries, Tyros. &#34;Do not mistake our challenges for weakness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael, standing directly behind Tharros, could scarcely suppress his displeasure. &#34;Perhaps you&#39;d like to test that theory, Shark Lord,&#34; he muttered, his tone low and threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s hand touched Kael&#39;s arm, anchoring him. &#34;We&#39;re here to strengthen the alliance, not break it apart,&#34; she stated forcefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyros&#39; attention shifted to Sophia, his sharp teeth glinting in the faint light. &#34;A surface dweller speaking for Aquaria now? Indeed, times are changing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael came forward, but Sophia stopped him with a gentle wave of her head. Instead, she approached Tyros directly. &#34;You mistrust us because you are afraid of what is going to happen. That is fair. But know this: whatever shadows emerge from the depths, we will confront them together. If you can&#39;t stand with us, please get out of our way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyros appeared startled for a minute, his countenance a mix of surprise and reluctant respect. He said nothing more, but the tension in the room persisted long after he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Kael sat alone in his chambers, the parchment from before spread out in front of him. Names of people he used to trust glared back at him, like ghosts. He felt the weight of every decision he&#39;d ever made, every fight fought, and every comrade killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet knock on the door interrupted his reverie. &#34;Come in,&#34; he growled, gruffly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia entered, and her presence soothed his strained nerves. &#34;You&#39;ve been avoiding everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael groaned and ran a hand over his hair. &#34;What is there to say?&#34; I am losing trust in all I believed in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia approached with a steady stare. &#34;You aren&#39;t alone in this, Kael. &#34;We will figure it out together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her, his gaze looking for something-hope, reassurance, anything to hang onto. &#34;What if I am incorrect, Sophia? &#34;What if my instincts lead us to ruin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her palm on his cheek, grounding him. &#34;Then let&#39;s confront it together. But, Kael, you&#39;ve never backed down from a fight. Do not start now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words soothed something within him, but before he could answer, a loud alarm rang through the corridors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael leapt to his feet, his warrior instincts kicking in. &#34;What now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s expression became stern. &#34;Let&#39;s find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived, the council room was alive with activity. Tharros stood in the center, his countenance a mix of fury and disbelief. Arin waited in the darkness, her acute eyes capturing every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Kael demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros turned, his voice low and menacing. &#34;One of the officers on that list was just caught attempting to sabotage our defenses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s stomach sank. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros gave him another parchment. Kael&#39;s heart sunk when he read the name. It was not just anyone. He thought this person to be a buddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked at Kael, concern on her face. &#34;What does this mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s voice was hardly audible. &#34;It means the fractures run deeper than we thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could answer, another alarm went off-a deeper, more sinister sound. The room became silent as they knew what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s Confession</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alarm&#39;s echoes had hardly gone before the council chamber descended into turmoil. Orders were yelled, warriors hurried to build defenses, and the impending arrival of the Leviathan loomed over everyone. Kael stormed out with Tharros, their sole focus on protecting Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia lingered, her mind racing as she attempted to put together the developing gaps in their fragile connection. From the corner of her eye, she observed Arin, who was abnormally motionless amidst the chaos, her face pale and her gaze remote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin?&#34; Sophia called quietly, hesitantly. The sea witch did not react, her gaze fixed on the empty area where Tharros had stood minutes before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia approached warily. &#34;Arin, are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Arin turned her head, her customary cutting assurance replaced with rawness and vulnerability. &#34;Come with me,&#34; she said quietly, her voice barely audible. Without waiting for a response, she went toward the chamber&#39;s side door, her motions rigid and rushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia followed, uneasiness rising in her chest. She had never seen Arin like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin took her to a small hidden area, dimly illuminated and lined with coral shelves and sparkling crystals. As the door closed behind them, the silence became deafening. Arin paced back and forth, her hands quivering slightly-a sight so strange that it sent shivers through Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin, what&#39;s going on?&#34; Sophia inquired, attempting to keep her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin came to a halt unexpectedly, her back turned to Sophia. &#34;I&#39;ve made mistakes, Sophia,&#34; she said, her voice low and tinged with an emotion Sophia couldn&#39;t identify. &#34;Grave ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia moved closer, her pulse increasing. &#34;What kind of mistakes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin looked around, her eyes sparkling with unshed tears. &#34;The kind that helped create the monster outside those walls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room appeared to tilt. Sophia squinted, convinced she had misheard. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin took a nervous breath, her fists tightening at her sides. &#34;The Leviathan is more than just a force of nature, Sophia. It&#39;s the product of old magic, which I was a part of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart thumped painfully in her chest. &#34;What do you mean you were part of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s gaze lowered, and her words hardly rose above a whisper. &#34;Centuries ago, before Aquaria was what it is now, I desired power. I was determined to prove myself, to break away from the grip of those who questioned me. I delved into forbidden magic-dark, ancient spells designed to harness the ocean&#39;s primal forces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt the weight of the revelation fall on her like a physical load. &#34;Arin, what did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I could control it,&#34; Arin explained, her voice shaking. &#34;I believed I could sculpt the magic and make it mine. But I was mistaken. The spell did not bind, but rather perverted, the ocean&#39;s power. It produced something... strange. Something that could not be contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia caught her breath as the parts fell into place. &#34;The Leviathan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded, tears flowing over. &#34;It was not always like this. It remained dormant for generations, trapped in the trenches where the magic originally took hold. But something has changed. The ocean&#39;s balance has shifted, and it is now... awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped back, her thoughts reeling. &#34;You... you caused this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to,&#34; Arin whispered anxiously, her voice heavy with grief. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize what I was unleashing. By the time I noticed, it was too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia struggled to comprehend the significance of what she was hearing. &#34;Why are you telling me this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you deserve the truth,&#34; Arin explained, her voice shaking. &#34;And because I need to know if you can still trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia sat heavily on one of the coral benches, hands grabbing the edge to keep herself stable. &#34;Arin, this... this changes everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Arin muttered. &#34;But you must believe me, Sophia. I&#39;ve spent millennia attempting to atone for my actions. Everything I&#39;ve done since-every spell, every sacrifice-has been to preserve Aquaria and prevent this from happening. But I failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked up to meet Arin&#39;s gaze. The raw pain was apparent. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell Tharros or Kael?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin gave a sour laugh. &#34;Do you think they will understand? Tharros would view it as betrayal. Kael never looked at me the same way again. &#34;And you-&#34; Her voice cracked. &#34;You&#39;re the only one I thought might listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s chest tightened. She wanted to shout and lash out at the unfairness of it all. But underlying the rage came something else: empathy. She could see the weight Arin carried, the years of shame engraved into every wrinkle of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin,&#34; Sophia said softly, &#34;you made a terrible mistake. But you aren&#39;t that person anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes widened, a glimmer of hope piercing her misery. &#34;You believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; Sophia replied firmly. &#34;But this is something we cannot keep to ourselves. Tharros and Kael should know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s face hardened. &#34;If they find out, they will kick me out-or worse. Do you know what that means? I&#39;ve worked too hard to make a home here. &#34;I can&#39;t lose it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia hesitated, divided between her allegiance to her colleagues and the link she was establishing with Arin. &#34;You mentioned that you wished to atone. &#34;That begins with honesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s shoulders dropped, the fight drained from her. &#34;I don&#39;t know if I have the strength to face them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia placed a hand on Arin&#39;s arm to ground her. &#34;You don&#39;t need to face them alone. &#34;We will do it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin appeared on the edge of breaking, her control dissolving. But then she straightened, her normal determination returning to her posture. &#34;Thanks, Sophia. For listening. &#34;For not turning your back on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, but the weight of the confession hung heavy between them. &#34;We will figure it out. But for now, we must concentrate on the Leviathan. Whatever happens next, we&#39;ll face it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they left the room, the corridors were strangely calm, the previous pandemonium replaced by an oppressive stillness. Sophia&#39;s thoughts raced with questions, doubts, and the gravity of the task ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin stopped at the intersection, her attention riveted on the shadows ahead. &#34;Sophia,&#34; she continued quietly, &#34;there&#39;s one more thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned as her gut tightened. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin hesitated before saying, &#34;The Leviathan... it&#39;s drawn to me.&#34; The magic that created it-my magic-is still present. If it finds me, it will attempt to utilize me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s blood became chilly. &#34;What does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means I&#39;m a liability,&#34; Arin explained, her tone harsh. &#34;And if it comes down to it... you might have to choose between saving me or saving Aquaria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked at her, the weight of her words crushing down like a tidal wave. Before she could react, the Leviathan&#39;s distant roar resonated throughout the city, rattling the walls and sending a new flood of horror through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The choice Arin mentioned was no longer hypothetical. It was coming. And it was coming quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Shadow&#39;s Reach</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s roar resonated across Aquaria, rattling the crystal walls and causing waves on every bioluminescent surface. Sophia stood motionless, her heart beating as she exchanged glances with Arin. There was no time to consider what had just been presented. The shadow was pressing in, and the city was far from prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael emerged in the corridor, his imposing appearance belied the storm rising behind his eyes. &#34;The outer settlements,&#34; he continued forcefully, &#34;we&#39;ve lost contact with three of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach sank. &#34;How long ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hours,&#34; Kael said. &#34;Patrols sent to investigate haven&#39;t returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros joined them, his golden eyes as steely as steel. &#34;The Leviathan&#39;s corruption is spreading quicker than we expected. It&#39;s not just the settlements; it&#39;s also the creatures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Sophia inquired, her voice wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros paused, then nodded to Kael. The warrior clinched his jaw as he motioned for them to follow. They went hurriedly down the winding halls, the Leviathan&#39;s massive presence pushing down with each stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chamber Kael brought them to was darkly lighted and filled with anxiety. In the center, a gigantic tank contained what appeared to be a monstrous fusion of sea life. Its shape was hideous, with rotting scales and unnaturally bright eyes. The thing struggled weakly, its movements unpredictable and disturbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what we&#39;re dealing with,&#34; Kael explained coldly. &#34;It was one of ours, a sentinel eel bred to protect the trenches. &#34;Now look at it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia approached the tank with caution, her heart aching at the sight. &#34;The corruption did this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded. &#34;And it is not isolated. There are reports of similar alterations in the surrounding regions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros crossed his arms, his visage a mask of controlled rage. &#34;This is exactly what the Leviathan wants: to destabilize us and turn our own defenses against us. &#34;If it gets to the capital...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t,&#34; Sophia said, her tone stern. &#34;We won&#39;t let it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael raised an eyebrow, doubt flaring in his eyes. &#34;And how exactly do you plan to stop something we can&#39;t even track?&#34;</p>
