                <p>Mr. Reynolds was busy doing something on his phone, I quickly took a short glance of him, but dang it, he saw me, he caught my eyesight. The situation turned so awkward for me that I directly started looking towards the window. My life was a complete &#34;The awkward moment&#34; type of book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver started the car and smoothened himself on the seat with the seat belt. It was such a quiet type of ride and boring indeed. All I could do was peep outside the window, look at the utmost hot guy whom I almost kissed at a party, and who didn&#39;t seem to care at all about it. Well, why would he? I neither matched his status nor expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I remembered the plan which involved seducing him, I could do a lot in this car which could make this day as the last but I needed money for my family and never wanted to do something so childish intentionally, though Francis guaranteed me a satisfying job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive faster, we&#39;re already running late &#34;, Mr. Reynolds looked towards the driver and patted his back motivating him to drive fast</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re already riding at the fasted speed?&#34; I interrupted them and continued &#34;More speed can lead to heart failure&#34;, for me this statement was hilarious but they didn&#39;t even react. Mr. Reynolds looked at me with cornered eyes and gave a sarcastic angry type of look and started typing something on his laptop again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver was not even stopping at speed breakers because of which I could not control with the hipping and hopping and sometimes getting pulled away towards Mr. Reynolds, I did control a lot because every time his body felt my touch, he looked at me like I hadn&#39;t bathed ever since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within 4 hours we were there in Pallapora town. It was an amazing town, people here had broad smiles plastered on their faces. They all looked so cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to this town, sir &#34;, A woman in her mid-thirties welcomed Mr. Reynolds with a flower bouquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pleasure&#34;, was the only word he said after receiving the warm welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice meeting you Miss&#34;, she gestured her hand towards me, I shook it warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too&#34;, I smiled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we have arranged a small party for you, we will be honored if you could gift us your presence&#34;, she said with a broad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, why not &#34;, Mr. Reynolds tightened his tie and replied in a very formal yet stubborn way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We then followed the woman and she took us to a conference hall room in a big building, which was nicely and elegantly decorated with white orchids as for welcoming Mr. Aaron Reynolds. I wondered why was he treated like one big celebrity at this place but I was certainly enjoying the attention I was getting because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall room was massive and had a big round table surrounded with wooden chairs and a projector screen in the middle. Mr. Reynolds directed me to pass his laptop which was placed in my hand. I did everything as per his instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Reynolds positioned himself in the middle and logged into his laptop which was connected with a wire to the projector. &#34;So, let&#39;s start with today&#39;s meeting&#34;, he rubbed his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I didn&#39;t miss much&#34;, James entered breathing heavily. It couldn&#39;t be doubted that he had been running this whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not much sir &#34;, the woman which gave us directions told him with a sweet smile and asked him water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James sat next to me. After James settled himself, we redirected our attention towards Mr. Reynolds again. &#34;So as we all know we have gathered here for the redevelopment of this town&#34; he opened the first slide of his power-point presentation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here is the plan constructed by my highly skilled engineers&#34;, the slide explained a lot about the overall map of the town. It showed a comparison between the older one and a revised new version of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people were already impressed by his plan as it could be felt with their facial expressions. &#34;This is a brief detailing about the number of schools, colleges, and malls we are going to create in this place&#34;, he explained while moving towards the next slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept explaining the redevelopment plan, and to be honest, the slides which he had prepared were very interesting and catchy. Anyone would love to have him take the project as his professionalism and perfection were well-known and he had an amazing public reputation and goodwill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting continued for an hour and then he concluded &#34;Nothing comes without any terms and conditions&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present at the meeting was puzzled but I wasn&#39;t. I knew that nothing ever came easy with this man. The mayor of the town stood from his position and questioned inquiring about the terms and conditions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Reynolds smirked in an evil manner and I knew that something bad was coming. &#34;I want this town to be renamed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All had this &#34;o&#34; kind of expression formed from their lips. I knew that this self-obsessed stubborn animal wanted this town to be named after him so that people could never forget his greatness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we&#39;d love to, but we need to know the name first&#34;, Mayor comforted himself on his seat and somehow looked okay with the changing of the town&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily Olivia &#34;, he closed the laptop and looked towards the Mayor and continued &#34;My mother&#39;s full name&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was completely flattered by the fact that he was doing something for someone who was not him. He was actually getting out of the self-centered zone, well at least in front of me, for the first time. This was a completely another side of him which I had never imagined of seeing. My heart almost melted towards the loving gesture of him for his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we agree to it but we have a condition too&#34;, the mayor thought for a while and responded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;State the obvious&#34;, Mr. Reynolds instinctively replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to attend the small party which will be held for your honor and live the night as per our tradition, precisely the dressing, food and the atmosphere. We want you to experience everything so that a part of our culture still has some amount of value left after redevelopment&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course &#34;, Mr. Reynolds loosened up his tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I will show you and the staff members their rooms to freshen up for the party tonight&#34;, the pleasant woman guided us to our rooms which were in a row. The best one was given to our boss, no complaints and the other remaining ones were given to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I freshened up, laid on the fluffy bed. Did I mention that it was a luxurious suite which had all the exotic facilities anyone would ever need? I rested for a while. On hearing a knock at the door, I quickly ran towards it. There was some lady who had a box in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, come in &#34;, I paved way for her to get in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am this is our traditional dress for you&#34;, I took the cutely wrapped box in my hand and unwrapped. On my deep observation of the dress, I realized that it had a blouse that was woven with the finest wool and had colorful flowers everywhere. Beneath was a full-length skirt which was very neatly embroidered and was of georgette material. The combination of wool with georgette was something I had never imagined but it looked flawless. Well, that&#39;s what makes traditions special and unique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the door when the woman left and comforted myself on the bed again. I was lazy and the best part was I knew it. Within a minute, I heard another knock on the door. I went towards the door after hopping out of the bed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am these are some snacks, in case you feel hungry&#34;, the same woman bought a tray full of delicious food. I kept it on the table and waved her goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then after 10 minutes, someone knocked again. I was frustrated because the people here definitely didn&#39;t want me to make out with the bed. I quickly went and opened the door again. The same lady stood there smiling cheerfully at me. I smiled at her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here is some traditional jewelry for you to pair with the costume&#34;, I took that from her hand and placed it on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard another knock on the door, this time I was combing my hair so it took me a while to open it. I purposely opened the door late. There was this same lady behind the door. I guess, she was secretly in love with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on time, don&#39;t be late&#34;, was all she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I&#39;m keeping the door open. Come whenever you feel like&#34;, I smiled dramatically and just closed the door without locking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly wore the skirt first and looked at myself in the mirror. Well, I looked hot in my black inner-wear. My bra had black stripes behind it so I just turned myself against the mirror and observed myself. &#34;I look so hot &#34;, I told myself while facing towards the mirror again. Well, I guess every girl has done this at least once in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the knock again, this time I was smart enough to let the door open. I shouted &#34;Come in&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, it was not that lady. In fact, it was not any lady. Mr. Reynolds didn&#39;t look or peeped in the room but instead came in the room directly. When he came closer and made eye contact I was shocked. My eyes widened out of embarrassment. I quickly covered myself with my hands, though I knew it was irrelevant. I couldn&#39;t help but expose some part of my skin, precisely, the intimate one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to ask, before entering a girl&#39;s room?&#34; I screamed on top of my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were the one who wanted me to come in. Maybe, you wanted me to look at the bolder version of you&#34;, he paused whilst eyeing me from the eye to toe and continued &#34;I did ask your permission&#34;, he smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought it was that lady, oh my God. My fault! &#34;, I facepalmed because of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his brows and examined me, specifically at the place which lacked clothing. It could be figured out from his eyeballs. &#34;Don&#39;t make the situation chaotic for yourself, I&#39;ve seen you in less clothing before&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; I shivered while I talked. It was the first time someone saw me like that. I couldn&#39;t talk. I just didn&#39;t want him to think about me as a cunt, though a day back I acted like one. When I wanted sensuous things to happen, they weren&#39;t, and now when I don&#39;t want anything intimidating to happen, things actually happened. Destiny plays, we&#39;re just the puppets to its show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll talk to you after you are fully dressed&#34;, Mr. Reynolds passed me the blouse and turned around, though it didn&#39;t make sense at all. He already had a view of the inner me. He knew I was embarrassed and he respected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly grabbed it from his hand and wore the blouse as fast as I could. Too many thoughts clicked in my mind like, What if he thinks I&#39;m a cunt or a local-whore or just some hoe who wants to attract men by keeping their door open whilst changing their dresses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready &#34;, he turned around towards me and looked at me again &#34;So what made you pay me a visit?&#34; I questioned diverting his focus from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I just wanted you to behave, that&#39;s what I came to tell you. I have this deal now, but since creating chaos in parties is your special talent, I decided to pre-warn you.&#34; Mr. Reynolds twisted his hat and looked very serious. This was the second time for the day when he was warning me. I was so embarrassed before, that I hardly noticed him. He was wearing a cowboy hat with a half brown coat within which was a puffed sleeved white shirt. He looked like a cowboy, a hot one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I promise&#34;, I was the one who was in need to divert my mind and keep a harder control on my eyes.</p>
