                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect to see Isaac in the conference room. I heard that his relationship with his father had worsened. But now it seemed that it was a rumor. Although he didn&#39;t sit beside Andre, he didn&#39;t look at me. Was it because of the slap yesterday? I didn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t know him at all now. Toby whispered Andre&#39;s joke in my ear. He said that he had never seen such a fat Alpha. I couldn&#39;t help but secretly laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since we all agree to the armistice, then...&#34; The secretary handed me the agreement. &#34;This contract has the conditions that I can give. Believe me, it is very generous.&#34; Andre had a fake smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the contents of the contract. The conditions were indeed very good. It could even be considered preferential treatment. This large sum of money was enough for the White Claw pack to strengthen their strength. However, I knew Andre too well. He must have some conspiracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked into Andre&#39;s eyes and read his thoughts. &#39;Hurry up and sign the agreement. This way, we can kill all of you when you are happy to accept the jewelry.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, although I expected that there was a conspiracy here, I did not expect that Andre was so despicable as an Alpha. Did he not care about his reputation at all? But now, even if I said that he wanted to tear the agreement unilaterally, no one would believe me. I had no evidence to prove his future actions. And he could change his words at any time. No, I had to find a way to control him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I refuse.&#34; I closed their agreement and saw the surprised eyes of everyone, including Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre did not expect me to refuse. His expression became excited. &#34;Why? Is there a problem with this contract?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem, but we don&#39;t want money.&#34; I ignored the puzzled eyes of Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what do you want?&#34; Andre was a little anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want your people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People? Do you want slaves?&#34; &#39;If you want slaves, isn&#39;t that better? I can buy them when they are killed.&#39; His idea disgusted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I want your men&#39;s family, wife, child, and parents of every warrior. We will treat them well until the consumption of our war is complete. Then we will send them back to you.&#34; If I could control the family of his warriors, even if Andre wanted to fight, they dared not do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want them to do? Didn&#39;t I give you money to replenish the loss of war?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just a little worried that if you break the agreement one-sidedly, we will be ambushed by you if we are unprepared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you doubting my integrity?&#34; Andre was exposed by me, and he began to shout because he was feared. &#34;How can I let my people go to other packs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about you.&#34; I showed a standard fake smile. &#34;All is fair in war, we have to make all preparations. If you don&#39;t intend to break the agreement, your people will naturally stay in our pack safely. You are so excited about my proposal. Do you really intend to break the agreement?&#34; I pretended to be surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, all eyes fell on Andre. His face had changed from green to red. He cleared his throat. &#34;Cough, of course not. Since you don&#39;t want money, it is not a bad thing for us. I will ask the warriors to call their families. But you have to guarantee their safety during this period.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can guarantee it with my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Andre was already sweating. &#34;Then let&#39;s stop here for today.&#34; He didn&#39;t have time to wipe off the sweat on his head before he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried my best to suppress the corners of my mouth from rising. Wanted to play tricks with me? He really picked the wrong person. The commanders followed Andre. Only Isaac sat in his original position and looked at me. His eyes were very complicated, but I didn&#39;t want to see him again. I got up and left, leaving Isaac in the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Andre sent dozens of people according to the agreement. They looked very uneasy. Of course, I could understand them, but if not for Andre&#39;s insidious ways that forced me to a dead end, I wouldn&#39;t have used the means of hostages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I could only try to appease them. &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry. The White Claw pack will treat you well. You just have to stay there for a while and you can go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked to a little girl. She should be the child of a warrior. I took her hand. &#34;I swore to protect you with my own life. If you have any difficulties, you can tell me. I will try to solve it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the little girl was still trembling slightly. I looked at her eyes and wanted to use hypnosis to calm her emotions. Then I read the little girl&#39;s thoughts. &#39;Alpha told us that we must not tell this pretty woman that we are slaves. Otherwise, we will be severely punished. &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Andre replace the hostage with slaves? His shamelessness made me angry. I read the thoughts of others. Sure enough, most of them were Omega and slaves. I understand. When we accepted the hostage, Andre would still tear up the agreement. He did not care about the life and death of the slaves at all. He would kill all of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually wanted to use this to trick me. Did he still think of me as a little girl? I immediately took the hostages to confront Andre. Andre was in the combat center. Coincidentally, his commanders were all here. This was a perfect stage. I would expose his hypocritical mask in front of his subordinates and let his people see what kind of despicable person he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you bring them here?&#34; Andre pointed to the people behind me and questioned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suspect that there is someone pretending to be a family member, Alpha.&#34; I especially emphasized his address, hoping that someone could hear my ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is that possible?&#34; The expression on Andre&#39;s face suddenly changed. I read his mind. &#39;How did this woman know? Didn&#39;t I threaten the slaves to keep quiet?&#39; But he still planned to continue lying to me. &#34;Do you have any evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed to Andre&#39;s guard. &#34;Your family should be here too, right? Which one?&#34; The guard looked at Andre for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a woman in the crowd raised her hand and said, &#34;I am his wife.&#34; The guard breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed that Andre had asked the slaves to prepare. Very well, I let the woman turn around and asked the guard, &#34;What color are your wife&#39;s eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard faltered for a long time, and then he guessed a brown, but that Omega had a pair of beautiful blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unexpectedly, you don&#39;t even remember what your wife looks like.&#34; I turned to Andre and asked, &#34;Do you want me to investigate one by one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of this was seen by the commanders. Andre covered it up with a lie. &#34;They may do this because they don&#39;t want their families to be hostages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can understand if the soldiers don&#39;t want to. But after I put forward the conditions, you easily agreed. As Alpha, you have no sincerity in our request. This will make me think that our negotiation is meaningless. Do you want to start a war now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre used up most of his combat strength just to resist the White Claw pack. I believed that he would not be stupid enough to declare war on us now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, peace is our common thought. There can&#39;t be any more bloodshed and deaths.&#34; He wanted to try to make it sound reasonable. &#34;Then let&#39;s adjust the agreement. I have to trouble you to stay longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, I was waiting for him to say this. I hadn&#39;t found out the truth about my parents. I couldn&#39;t leave now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time was getting shorter and shorter, but I still couldn&#39;t find out anything about my parents. It was especially difficult for me to find out information about Andre and the people around him. They were all very wary of me. I didn&#39;t eat much for dinner today. My mind was full of plans to find some informants to help me collect information. But Toby called me to a stop. I had never seen him so serious. Maybe I was too busy these days and ignored him. I should explain it to him when I got back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what I didn&#39;t expect was that he came over and held my hand. &#34;Claudia, I fell in love with you from the first time I saw you. I will always be with you. Give me a chance, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Why?&#34; Other than doubt, I did not have any other emotions. I had always regarded Toby as the cute younger brother. Not long ago, I even attended his coming of age ceremony as an elder. But now that I thought about it, I was only two years older than him. Moreover, the boy in front of me was a full head taller than me. I felt that he was about the same height as Isaac. Moreover, his high cheekbones and brow bones made him look more mature than his actual age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s worse was that his dark brown eyes were full of undisguised love. I had never had this feeling for him. How could I refuse him without hurting his heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I had struggled in my mind for too long. Toby touched my hair and his face slowly enlarged in front of me. Help, was he going to kiss me? Was it too hurtful to push him away directly? How I wanted someone to save me from this embarrassing situation now.</p>
