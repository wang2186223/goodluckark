                <p>Grabbing the sheets even tighter, I let out a soft moan as I gazed into Nero&#39;s eyes. My body ached, and we had been at it for the longest, yet wherever he touched started a fire that needed to be quenched by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the sound of his phone alarm started buzzing, and Nero stopped thrusting, giving me a moment to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drowsiness I felt made my eyelids fall a little, and I struggled to open my eyes when I heard Nero say, &#34;It&#39;s six o&#39;clock already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned his focus back to me, pressed his body against mine, and  I could feel him deeper inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,&#34; Nero said, his lips brushed against my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sleepy,&#34; I cried out, squeezing the sheet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he leaned toward my lips, I wrapped my hands around his neck as he whispered, &#34;Of course. We had sex all night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of embarrassment spiked in me, and my face felt hot, but my eyes remained glued on him, unable to get over the fact that he was smiling at me warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything that had happened between us in the past, a moment like this was something I imagined wouldn&#39;t be possible between us since he was so firm about rejecting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Nero allowed my body to rest and dropped beside me on the bed, drawing a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, I turned on my side, admiring his face and listening to the sound of his heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Nero suddenly gazed at me for a moment and said, &#34;I know how much of a jerk I&#39;m going to sound like, saying this right after such a moment. But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But?&#34; I whispered, biting on my bottom lip, already guessing what he was about to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you keep the bite mark a secret and hidden until it fades during the next full moon which will be like twenty-nine days from now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened between us was just sex and nothing more. How could I be stupid to think that he wanted to claim me as his mate! And now I bear the mark of an Alpha that doesn&#39;t want me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you say something, please?&#34; Nero softly uttered, staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling dizzy, I shut my eyelids, not knowing what to say or how to reply. He made it clear from the beginning that he couldn&#39;t be my alpha, so how could I blame him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the drowsiness I felt abandoned me, I held in my breath, refusing to raise my eyelid when I felt the bed move under me because I didn&#39;t want to see him since it was going to ruin my mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want anything to eat?&#34; I heard Nero&#39;s voice, and I slowly raised my lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nero sat on the couch, his eyes remained glued to mine, and I hesitated for a moment before saying, &#34;Last night meant nothing to you, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make you something. What do you want to eat?&#34; Nero uttered with calmness in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I stared at the stern expression on his face, and then I sighed deeply, &#34;Are you going to keep dodging my questions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will make some toast. If you feel hungry, come down to eat.&#34; Nero uttered with his eyes cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have an appetite, so don&#39;t waste your time making some for me,&#34; I said with a bit of an attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing! I&#39;m not hungry, &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you not want food?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I not have a saying in this too! Or are you going to make the decision for me and force me to eat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I pressed my lips together and squeezed my eyes shut, not knowing what to feel or think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I waited patiently for Nero to leave the room, and after he did, feeling mad at me and hurt, I threw the blanket over my head and curled myself into a ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pathetic, that&#39;s how I felt, and memories about my life kept rushing back to my mind, causing me an intense headache as tears rolled from the corners of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the warm liquid rolling down my chin, I detest that again I was looked down on and treated like I wasn&#39;t worth it, and I clenched my fist, sniffing back my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I laid still for a while, I gathered all my strength, pushed the cover off me, and got out of bed before dragging myself into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the face basin, I looked at the mirror,  frowning at my reflection for a moment, and then rubbed my hand on the back of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, I felt the bite mark on my skin. Then I turned my back to the mirror, pulled my hair from the back of my neck, and threw it over my shoulder to the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stared at the bite mark, my heart sank because a part of me wanted for it to mean something, and it did to me, but not to Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was now my Alpha, but only for a temporary period because the initial bite-mark on my shoulder is temporary and will disappear by the next full moon. It hurts to know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my shower, I walked back into a room, walked over to the closet, and took out an oversized turtleneck sweater and sweatpants. Then I got dressed into them, wore my slippers, and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived downstairs, I made my way to the kitchen because that was where I picked up Nero&#39;s scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I stopped at the entrance of the kitchen and gazed at Jason before focusing on Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you cooking?&#34; Jason asked, and then he glanced at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I am hungry,&#34; Nero mumbled, taking the frying pan off the stove. &#34;Also, I have to get to the campus early,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing his brows into a frown, Jadon looked at his phone and mumbled, &#34;Your class starts at nine, and it&#39;s one past seven. Why are you going to work so early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you stop asking me too many damn questions!&#34; Nero lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitchen fell silent as I watched him scratch his forehead and sigh before fixing his gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just stop with the questions, okay?&#34;  Nero said, resting his hands flat on the counter and sighing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Jason turned his focus on me and intensely stares at me before saying, &#34;Okay,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In silence, I watched Nero scoop out the egg and placed it on his toast. Then he slapped a cheese onto it and put another slice of bread on top before taking a huge bite into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are devouring that bread like you have been starving for days.&#34; Jason chuckled while staring at  Nero taking another bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nero threw me a hard look and then froze with the bread towards his lips as his eyes darted away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Jason stared back at me and teased, &#34;Did you catch the flu or something?! Why are you dressed like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his words, my stiff expression didn&#39;t change as I walked into the kitchen, headed over to the refrigerator, and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get ready for work.&#34; Nero abruptly uttered, and my attention drew back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After tossing the half-eaten bread on the plate, he looked at me for a moment before walking out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, what happened between you guys last night?&#34; Jason asked as he approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I simply stared at him for a moment before slamming the fridge shut and walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I headed for the cupboard, Jason hurried after me and when I opened it, I could feel his eyes on me as I stretched my hand for the cereal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Jason suddenly took a step closer to me and reached for the box, beating me to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned around to face him, I threw him a dirty look, and immediately, he handed the Cereal towards me and said, &#34;Okay, don&#39;t hit me. Here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, I grabbed the box and walked away from the counter. Then I sat on the stool, shoved my hand into the box, and pulled out a handful of cereal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You good?&#34; Jason asked, stunned as he gazed at me stuffed it into my mouth. &#34;Did Nero and you argue or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I refused to answer his questions, Jason finally stared at me quietly, watching me eat another handful of dry cereal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I pulled my hands from the box and lashed out, &#34;Why are you gazing at me?! Don&#39;t you have somewhere to be, far away from me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jason said nothing and kept looking at me, and when I raised my gaze to meet his face, the corners of his eyes creased with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I mumbled a bit calmer this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About last night your scent,&#34; Jason said, sitting down on the stool beside me. &#34;Are you an Omega? Or an alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A feeling of hesitation held me still for a moment. Then I set the box of cereal on the counter, sighed as I faced him, and said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. One minute, I am ordinary, and the next, puff! I am this. Whatever it is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ain&#39;t you supposed to be wolfless?&#34; Jason mumbled, his eyes dull with bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but Nero said that I&#39;m just a late shifter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you are going to transform a few days from now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The full moon is three days from now. So, your first shift might happen then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was about to speak, my words got stuck in my throat as I stared at Nero, standing at the kitchen door, dressed for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I focused back on Jason and said in a bold tone, &#34;I hope so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my eyes back at Nero, I gave a smug smile and said, &#34;Then I can be free to run with the wind and get out of this shitty state! Leaving bad memories behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mated to two sisters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***********Nero Pov*********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Blake reached for the cereal box, shoved her hand into it, and ate a few.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her remark, it seemed like she was planning to run away after her first transformation, and that was a good thing for me, for my plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, even though I am not still certain that she is my mate, a part of me wants her to stay. Why? I don&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, we Fangs alphas had difficulty finding our mates because of a curse, and only when we go through hell, are we certain that she is the one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why losing my mother really shattered my father because of how long it took him to realize that she is the one, his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it be the same for me? Is Blake mine, but I don&#39;t know yet because of the curse, or am I mixing up sympathy as a connection, and my mate is out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These are questions that haunt my dreams. Questions that I want to know because I still don&#39;t feel it yet, that Blake is the one, even after such an intimate night with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But like Jason said, how will I know she&#39;s the one when I don&#39;t know the feeling of a bond between mates? It is complicated. There is so much at stake here, my pack, my life, and everything that matters to me since I already has made the move of entering the Dark moonlight pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I need to be hundred percent sure that Blake is my mate because accidentally claiming my enemy&#39;s daughter is chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get to work,&#34; I mumbled, looking at Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of annoyance crossed her face, then ignoring my presence, she rolled her eyes at me, sighed, and then ate another handful of cereal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her attitude was understandable, I took her virginity and refused to claim her as my mate even though she bears my mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, what is going on between you two?!&#34; Jason shouted out, looking at Blake. Then he swayed his gaze at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I walked away without replying, headed out of the villa, and got into my Bugatti Dove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of minutes drive, I arrived on the campus and parked my vehicle in the parking lot. But as I was about to get down, my front door opened, and Karen entered my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked at me and cheerfully said, &#34;Good morning, Nero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in the little black dress that made her body&#39;s gentle shape appear curvy, her narrow shoulders exposed, her round hips and breasts standout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, Miss Noble,&#34; I said, striving not to give in to my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping the grin on her face, she leaned in close towards me and said, &#34;I know a secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste my time, Miss Noble,&#34; I mumbled in annoyance as I pulled my keys out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling like some dummy who didn&#39;t hear a word I said, Karen met my eyes and mumbled &#34;I know that you lie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to entertain her nonsense anymore, I pushed the car door open, and as I was about to get out, Karen uttered, &#34;Does Luna know that her sister spent a night at your house and not a motel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The annoyance that I felt quickly shifted into anger, and I sat back in the car, slamming the door shut, and then asked, &#34;Do you have proof of this nonsense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but I saw you leaving campus with her in your car,&#34; Karen said in a defensive tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at her in annoyance, I took a deep breath and said, &#34;Get out of my car, Miss Noble. I have a class to teach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you!&#34; Karen abruptly said, gazing directly into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop spitting rubbish and get out. I don&#39;t have time to entertain a love confession from someone I have no feelings for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not afraid that if you refuse me, I will take my anger out on Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile surfaced on Karen&#39;s lips as I leaned towards her, close enough to inhale her warm breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t take people&#39;s threats very lightly, Miss Noble! I have no use for you, so get the fuck out of my way or you might get hurt, really badly!&#34; I told her, gazing deep into her nervous gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of her lips raised into a mocking smile, and then she whispered, &#34;The hunt started last night, and I bet Blake is at your place. That&#39;s why no one can track her scent, just like the first time she went missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a second, I had my hand around Karen&#39;s throat, and I banged her against the car door, giving in to my anger. But that smug smile didn&#39;t fade off her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I convince my dad to search your house, and see if I am right?&#34; Karen whispered with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with anger, my fingers grew tighter on Karen&#39;s neck, and she finally began to struggle, gripping onto my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she grabbed my wrist and strived to pull my hand from around her throat, and when she finally started making choking noises, I loosen my grip on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, she drew a deep breath and clutched her chest, coughing slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep pushing your luck with me, and I wouldn&#39;t mind making Mr. Noble fatherless. Take this as a warning and get your ass out of my car!&#34; I told her, suppressing my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t do well with threats,&#34; Karen calmly said with a coy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither do I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh. I will leave for now. Take my confession into consideration. Until we see each other again, Nero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After staring at me for a brief while, Karen pushed the car door open and got down, slamming the door shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is my life getting tricky again? It&#39;s like the more I try to live right, I&#39;m haunted by my bloodline, and I&#39;m dragged back to the killing and darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I am trying to do it morally and kill the right people, avoiding the innocent ones. Something I regret not doing in the past. But now, I feel like it&#39;s getting impossible each day to play the nice guy, especially with this beast inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting to class a couple of minutes later, I tried not to pay attention to Karen and teach, even though during the entire lesson she had her eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my one-hour, twenty-five-minute lecture finally ended, I left the classroom and stopped in the hallway as I watched Luna wave at me with a smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna,&#34; I mumbled, approaching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I walked over to her, and she giggled softly before mumbling, &#34;Hey you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to grab breakfast together? I didn&#39;t eat anything before coming here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, I was smoking with anger, and yet my face didn&#39;t lose its calm expression when I picked up Karen&#39;s scent behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her voice speared through my ear, making me feel a stab of anger in my heart, &#34;So cheesy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karen,&#34; Luna said, her eyes darkened with hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna!&#34; Karen uttered, crossing her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; I told Luna as I grabbed her by her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I walked away with Luna, and she obediently followed. As we headed down the hallway, I could feel people&#39;s eyes on her, and a few students even took a picture of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting close to Loki&#39;s favorite daughter to earn his trust and the respect of the pack was the perfect move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got in the parking lot, I stop, and she did, looking adorably at my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My car or your car?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yours,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I drove the vehicle in front of the cafe and parked it. Then Luna and I got down from the car and walked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we took a seat at the corner of the room, she looked at me with excitement in her eyes and said, &#34;There&#39;s another reason I asked you to come here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m listening,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The full moon is approaching. We have only a few days to prepare for it. By then my pack will be expecting me to&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. The sooner I am marked, the better. The clan will not accept an unmarked Luna, especially a she-wolf. My mother is hopeful that it will happen this full moon since I will be nineteen next year. But that&#39;s not what I wanted to ask you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok-kay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of disappointment crossed Luna&#39;s face, and even though I noticed it, I said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a pure Alpha, I can have more than one partner, and being a cursed wolf, I have no emotional attachment to anyone which makes it even more simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even though I knew what Luna was asking of me, I felt hesitant because the full moon will be the time Blake is assumed to have her first transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s going to be a whole lot of pain and emotional for her, and I can&#39;t leave her in the care of Jason, knowing how unstable Blake can get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you come to the pack run with us? Since you are new in town, it will help others warm up to you and accept you.&#34; Luna uttered, lowering her gaze to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t,&#34; I told her, and I could just see the color drain from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf is wild, and I haven&#39;t transformed since sixteen years ago, and also, Loki knew my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please tell me I am not the only one that feels the bond between us?&#34; Luna suddenly uttered, pouting at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both sisters believe me to be their mate? What game was fate playing on me here!</p>
