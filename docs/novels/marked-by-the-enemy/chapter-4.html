                <p>After stepping on the brake pedal, I pushed the driver&#39;s door open and rushed out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I headed over to the back door, opened it, and then reached into the backseat for Blake. When my hand touched her skin, my eyes widened with panic glowing in them because she was burning up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I had lifted Blake from the car seat, I tightened my grip on her arms and legs before racing with her into my house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, I got in my room with Blake and carried her to the bed, resting her on the mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her clothes were messy with bloodstains, and I noticed that she was in a lot of pain from the look of distress on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was nothing that I could do for her since she begged me when I was carrying her out of the class not to take her home or to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So here I was with a student of mine in my bedroom, on my mistress, and taking such a bold risk for someone who I shouldn&#39;t be messing with at such a critical time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An intense growl suddenly echoed from outside of my room, and picking up Jason&#39;s scent, I headed out the door, opened it before walking to my closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shifted,&#34; I mumbled, looking back at a gray wolf entering my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I screw my face into a frown as Jason&#39;s started shifting into a human while he growled out the pain of the transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, I was staring at his bare body, and I sighed out my frustration before tossing a shirt and pants to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I smelled blood and thought something happened to you,&#34; Jason replied, sounding a bit angry as he got dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you think that? Don&#39;t you know my scent?&#34; I mumbled, slamming my closet close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But I&#39;m trying to adjust to this new territory! You know how dangerous it is for us to be here of all places. But you suddenly made us pack up and come anyway!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to stay back with the pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I felt bad for deceiving Jason, I know if he knew the truth about why I decided to move here, he will bug me to stop and go back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why, for now, all he knows is that I needed a fresh start, away from running the companies and taking care of the pack, but mostly for me to get away from all the bloodshed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so unbelievable. What beta would I be if I abandon my alpha?!&#34; Jason argued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then stop complaining about the move!&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It fell silent between us for a moment. Then Jason asked, &#34;Why does your room smell of blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of her?&#34; I replied, staring at the sweat dripping down Blake&#39;s face and how tightly her tender fingers had grabbed onto my sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After looking at Blake for a moment, Jason glared back at me and asked with a frown, &#34;Who is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, who is she!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I kept silent, knowing that he wasn&#39;t going to like my next words. Then I faced him and said, &#34;Loki Hayes&#39;s daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, please tell me you didn&#39;t just bring home the alpha of the Dark moonlight pack into your home!&#34; Jason firmly uttered, looking at me in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I won&#39;t tell you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero! Why would you help a girl like her when you clearly kno&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, my eyes grew cold as I firmly said, &#34;Watch your tongue, Jason! I&#39;m your Alpha first and your friend last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, alpha. But I don&#39;t think you should be messing with Loki&#39;s daughter, especially if you want that fresh start that you came here for.&#34; Jason said, coldly eyeing Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I know. But something happened in the classroom, and for some reason, I couldn&#39;t resist helping her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-he, sh..ee&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause, and then I sighed, taking a long look at Blake before mumbling, &#34;Nothing,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero,&#34; Jason mumbled with a touch of concern in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you can see, I&#39;m fine so you can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my beta turned to walk away, I looked at his back and said, &#34;Jason, once you leave the house tonight, don&#39;t return until tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Jason hesitated before walking to the door. Then he stared at Blake for a moment and left the room, quietly closing the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just me and her in the room again, and even though I didn&#39;t know what to expect, I knew that Blake was not like us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have heard that Loki has a hybrid who&#39;s wolfless. But I know what I saw in that class, and it was nothing short of extraordinary. Blake could be a lot of things. But being wolfless is not a part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Blake suddenly let out a moan, I walked over to the bed and sat beside her, watching her heal just like any other werewolf out there, even more, faster than them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a couple of seconds, her face was without a wound or scar, and I felt nothing short of amazed by that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After watching Blake for a while, I felt thirsty, so I stood to leave, but I suddenly felt a hand grab onto my wrist, so I stopped and gazed down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fang,&#34; Blake mumbled, slowly raising her lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked, even though I could tell from her wet eyes and the needy look on her face what she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am hot,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t strange to me that she would say those words because she had all the signs of an omega about to go in heat. It was no wonder she slept through my entire class. It must have been the effect of the preheat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My body feels weird,&#34; Blake moaned as her hand tightened around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that her irises had shifted into a hazel color of red and yellow as they did back in the classroom, I felt a bit uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Blake began releasing two opposite pheromones, and it was exactly like the scent that I picked up from her back in the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than a minute, my room became full of Blake&#39;s pheromones, and even though I was striving to restrain my wolf from reacting to her scent, her pheromones were rising and becoming powerful by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was making me lose control of my wolf slowly. After a couple of minutes had passed, I suddenly realized that another aroma was mixed with hers and that it was mine. My scent wasn&#39;t masked anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a good smell...coming from you, professor Fang,&#34; Blake moaned out, fastening her grip on my hand as I tried to pull away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not your alpha, Blake! You need to let go of my wrist because I&#39;m going to lose myself within a matter of seconds if I stay here, and it wouldn&#39;t be good for either of us.&#34; I mumbled, pulling her fingers off my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Blake immediately grabbed my other wrist and softly sobbed, &#34;Help me please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she was in her first omega heat, yet, she was releasing an alpha pheromones too and was making it tricky to resist her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could realize what was going on, Blake suddenly yanked me down to the bed, pinpointing me against the mattress and lacking both my wrists in her grips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she leaned toward my neck and bit into it before slowly licking against my neck, causing me to growl out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tongue against my skin felt ticklish, and I strived not to react to the excitement I felt from that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Blake! Get off me!&#34; I mumbled, feeling a bit dizzy from her bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But your scent is so addictive, and you taste so delicious. I don&#39;t think I can stop.&#34; Blake mumbled, staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing into her eyes, I realized that I wanted this, I wanted her, and I didn&#39;t know if I could restain myself anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Just what is this?&#39; I thought as I stared into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An Omega first heat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting her palms flat against my chest, Blake looked at me and mumbled, &#34;Mr. Fang, why ain&#39;t you doing anything, and just looking at me. Don&#39;t you want to touch me too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I uttered, frowning at her. &#34;What do you think you are doing now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to dare me, uh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the look of confusion in her ignorant eyes, I drew upward towards her face and said, &#34;I have never felt this way before, especially to a woman because it shouldn&#39;t be possible. What did you do to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing happened for a moment as I lay still, staring at her while she pouted at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I finally relaxed, I suddenly felt Blake&#39;s fingers slowly stroking against my stomach as her other hand pulled up my shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when she reached for my trouser button, I hastily grabbed her hand and shifted her to the bottom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of Blake, the feeling of her so close to me, and the way her fingers traced against my bare skin made me lose it completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relinquishing control of my wolf for a moment, I took the blazer off her and gazed at the sleeveless sheer crop top on her that revealed the shape of her breast and swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I wanted to stop there, I found myself wanting more, and I wriggled my hand into her blouse, brushing against her nipple as I pressed my face against her stomach and inhaled her scent deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her soft moan made my wolf go wild and I slid my other hand into her pants, making her wail loudly from the movement of my fingers as they caressed between her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Fang,&#34; Blake softly moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice caused me to take back control for a moment, and when I gazed into her wet eyes, I felt guilty and yet tempted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heated by Blake&#39;s look,  my teeth started to shift, and I leaned towards her neck, really to mark her. But realizing that I was acting out of lust and not true emotions, I stabbed my fangs into my palm instead, tasting my blood on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you stop,&#34; Blake whispered in my ear as she embraced me tightly, sniffing my neck deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pheromones are becoming too damn strong for me to continue controlling myself in her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, sweat was now dripping down my forehead, and I felt like Blake was emotionally and mentally bending me to her will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing I couldn&#39;t mark or claim an omega that I had no interest in keeping, I felt that it was unfair to Blake to mark her just to reject her in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I removed from on top of her and hastily rolled off the bed, dropping hard to the floor. Then I jumped to my feet and ran outside, slamming the door shut behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Fang!&#34; Blake&#39;s voice echoed out from the other end of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to her soft cry, I rested my head on the door frame and mumbled, &#34;I&#39;m not your alpha! You are just confused because I was the first thing your wolf saw when it awoke and got in heat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As time drifted by, Blake&#39;s moaning began to fade until it suddenly got quiet, and when I realized that she had finally calmed down, I slowly turned the knob and opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After closing the door behind me, I walked over to the bed and gazed at Blake&#39;s calm, sleeping face before heading to the couch and taking a seat on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like fate was playing some kind of twisted trick on me, making me meet her the moment I arrived in the state, even though it knew why I was here and why I have never claimed anyone as my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, when I finally swayed my gaze towards the wall clock, I realized that I had been sitting in this exact spot for hours, just staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I dragged my gaze on Blake and saw her hands brush against the sheets, and then her lashes repeatedly blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her eyelids rose, and I sluggishly rested back on the couch, feeling relief that she was back to her normal self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where am I?&#34; Blake shakingly mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thought that crossed my mind after hearing those words was that she had a memory loss and didn&#39;t recall anything that happened to her after the accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Blake gazed my way, and when our eyes met, I was about to speak when she screamed forcing me to clap my hands over my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously,&#34; I mumbled, scowling at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I stood from the couch, hardening my face, and walked towards the bed, gazing intensely at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Fang, I...&#34; Blake whispered, barely able to get her words out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember everything that happened today?&#34; I calmly asked, sitting beside her on the mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darting her eyes away from me, Blake remained silent. But when her cheeks turned red, I already had my answer. Yet, I wanted to hear it from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Blake slightly nodded and mumbled, &#34;All of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of us didn&#39;t utter a word for a while. But after a couple of silent minutes had passed, Blake suddenly looked deep into my eyes and asked, &#34;What do you think happened to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she slowly lowered her gaze and mumbled, &#34;Because to be honest, I feel attracted to you in a way that I can&#39;t explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wolf imprinted on me!&#34; I said, realizing the moment that those words escaped my lips that things were never going to be the same again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting down on her bottom lip, Blake nervously glanced at me. Then she dropped her gaze to the bed and mumbled, &#34;So what are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Other than our relationship as a student and teacher, we are nothing.&#34; I firmly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words were way too harsh, especially after everything that just happened between us. But they were the words she needed to hear to move on because love wasn&#39;t something I could offer her or anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her fist, Blake looked hesitating, and then she softly intoned, &#34;I thought you said,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That your wolf imprinted on me?&#34; I asked, frowning slightly. &#34;Blake, I can choose whether to accept you as my soulmate or not, and honestly, whatever, you feel for me, I don&#39;t feel it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips together, Blake raised her head and fixed her sad eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she slowly swayed her gaze towards the left and mumbled beneath her breath, &#34;And I&#39;m getting rejected already. Haha, how pathetic can you get, Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were a lot of things I was expecting her to say to me, but what she said wasn&#39;t what I was expecting to hear and I felt some sense of remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Striving to smooth the tension between us, I sighed softly and said,  &#34;It&#39;s not about rejecting you. But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it! You don&#39;t want me! So don&#39;t deepen the wound by trying to make me feel better!&#34; Blake whispered, clutching onto her blouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are still young&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m nineteen! According to the law, I&#39;m an adult!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even know what you want!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no doubt to me that she was now pissed because she threw her hands in the air and shouted, &#34;I don&#39;t know! But apparently, my wolf believes it&#39;s you because it has me having all these stupid feelings for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you think your wolf chose me?&#34; I asked, meeting her eyes as I tried to understand what the connection between us was so I could break it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew silent, and only the sound of our breath could be heard as both of us stared deep into each other&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Blake mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it carefully for a moment,&#34; I calmly said, placing my finger under her chin and lifting her head to meet my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why me, Blake?&#34; I whispered,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because among them all, you are a lesser douchebag,&#34; Blake said as she raised her lashes, gazing into my eyes. &#34;You are the first person to show me some kind of kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring into her anxious gaze, I felt a bit nervous, not knowing what to make of what she was feeling or what she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I withdrew my hand away from her and said, &#34;I&#39;m a teacher, Blake. Being nicer to my students is a part of my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a touch of anxiety in Blake&#39;s eyes, she shrugged her shoulders and asked, &#34;Okay, so what does that mean?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silent fell between us, and even though I had not uttered a word, her tears had already begun to pour down her face, and her eyes became dull with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m indifferent to you. I shouldn&#39;t feel uninterested when it comes to my mate.&#34; I said, standing from the bed. &#34;I don&#39;t feel what you feel, Blake. That&#39;s what it means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked into her teary eyes, the first thought that crossed my mind was to clarify why I felt that way, and yet, when I opened my mouth, no words came out because I didn&#39;t want to keep her hope up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate this moment with everything in me!&#34; Blake whispered, her voice thick with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get some rest,&#34; I said, turning away from her. &#34; If you want to freshen up, I have some large shirts in my closet. You can wear any of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to walk away, my wolf instinct kicked in, and I hastily turned around and caught the pillow that she threw at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does my wolf have to bound itself to you! I hate your face and you!&#34; Blake screamed, sniffing aggressively as her tears escaped her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. Hate me. That&#39;s what&#39;s best for both of us.&#34; I said with a straight face, tossing the pillow back on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent as Blake stared at me. Then when she didn&#39;t utter another word, I walked away, and as I was about to close the door, she screamed,  &#34;What an ass!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about the way Blake said those words sent a dull throb through my heart as I slammed the door shut and let go of the knob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What kind of sick joke is fate playing on both of us!&#39; I thought, gazing at the door before walking away.</p>
