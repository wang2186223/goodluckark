                <p>He&#39;s my teacher</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s nothing weirder than walking into a room filled with male werewolves, taking a shit, or peeing, and I felt my body shut down just by thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I haven&#39;t transformed into my wolf yet, my werewolf gene is quite active, and I had some of the abilities like quick healing power and the sense of smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate decided to screw me up and also make my human gene dominant which means that I was a weak being with no powers of speed, strength, and most of the cool stuff that comes with being a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a deep breath, I realized that whoever I was in the room with, didn&#39;t have a scent, and it kind of freaked me out because only alphas could hide their scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of minutes went by in silence. Then chills ran down my spine as a cold voice echoed into my ears, &#34;Did you understand what I said, or are you deaf!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arrogance in his tone made me lose it, and I lashed out without thinking, &#34;I heard you the first time. There&#39;s no need to be rude, you know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly became quiet, and I started to panic a bit so I raised my head only to lock gaze with a pair of cold eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, I was thrown off because he was handsome with his black, silky hair tied up in a bun, multiple piercings on his right ear, tattoo on his neck, and scythe-shaped eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if I wanted to, I couldn&#39;t deny the fact that his roman nose, half-dome cheekbones, sitting above an oaken jaw, and his burly physique made him the most gorgeous man that I have seen in my lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thought that crossed my disturbed mind was if he was a new student because I have never seen him on this campus before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, I am the kind of person who doesn&#39;t have any friends and is someone who spends most of her days hiding from bullies since I am a magnet who attracts them everywhere I go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I would know if a student like him exists on our campus since the omegas in this school are thirsty and horny for guys like him, especially if he&#39;s an alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s some mouth you have there.&#34; He coldly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, my face grew pale, and I took a step backward, pressing my back against the door as I stared at those cold red irises of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If a werewolf becomes an Alpha, he or she will then have red eyes, and now that his eyes have shifted, I did not doubt whose presence I was in which made my fear deepen into dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for walking in here!&#34; I mumbled, knowing not to push my luck with an alpha. &#34;I will leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My only desire at this point was to get the hell out of there because I already had one intense interaction with an alpha, I needed not another with one more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, stay.&#34; He said with his eyes still piercing into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After years of being ill-treated by the pack and my family, I have become thick-skinned to brutality and a bit too bold for my own good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he told me to stay, or I wanted was to vanish and get out of there because if I get into trouble with him and my complaint is filed in the office and my dad gets called, I can consider myself a &#39;walking dead,&#39; literally and not in the sense of zombies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I didn&#39;t mean to walk in here. It was a mistake, and I&#39;m going to leave, like now!&#34;  I mumbled, swallowing my pride and giving in to the feeling of humbleness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, &#39;stay!&#34; He said coldly but in a calm tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His deep voice made me more anxious to leave, and yet I didn&#39;t dare to look away from his face or move, even though I wanted to, desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having nothing but awful thoughts torturing my mind, I watched him approach me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he reached me, I squeezed my eyes shut and thought, &#39;It&#39;s only been a few minutes, and I&#39;m already into a mess! My life fucking sucks!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here! Wear this.&#34; I suddenly heard him saying, and slowly, I opened my eyes, feeling hesitant to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I looked at the blazer in his hand and felt dumbfounded because he was handing it over to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>what the heck was going on? How did we move from him looking so aloof to him handing me his coat? Nothing was making sense to me at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Not wanting to offend him, I reached for it and mumbled, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without replying, he waved his hand to the left and kept his cold eyes fixed on me as his face hardened into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I whispered, hoping so desperately that I wouldn&#39;t offend him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes at me, he coldly uttered, &#34;You are in my way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, I couldn&#39;t decide if he was a jerk or just was having a bad morning like myself. Either way, I chose not to say anything offensive even though I was annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, sorry,&#34; I hastily said, stepping away from the doorway and walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I watched as he walked out of the bathroom and slammed the door behind him before staring down at the blazer in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fabric looked expensive, and I glared at it for a moment, judging if he was another rotten wolf from a wealthy background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would he give it to me?&#34; I mumbled, pouting slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling of excitement wasn&#39;t something that I knew. Yet, as I continued staring at the blazer, his face suddenly crossed my mind, and my lips uncontrollably curved upward into a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the heck! I have never felt lovey-dovey over anyone, and the instant I realized what was happening inside of me, I snapped out of my feelings and walked over to the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked into the mirror and my gaze rested on the reflection of the bloodstain on my sweater, I smiled as I mumbled, &#34;Maybe the world isn&#39;t full of crappy people after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a couple of minutes, I continued to gaze at the reflection of my face in the mirror and the stains of blood on my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was annoying to see even though this was not the first time and not a worst-case scenario as the others have been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pulling the hoodie off my head, I turned the faucet on, and then ran my tender fingers through my hair, pushing it back away from my face before slipping a rubber band off my slender wrist and wrapping my hair in a high ponytail with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fairly enough, unlike my half-sister &#34;Luna,&#34; I looked nothing like my father with my dainty nose, black eyes, straight hair, and heart-shaped lips. But I did have his fair complexion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After washing my face for a while, I turned off the faucet and patted my skin dry with a paper towel before gazing at my image in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bruises are gone,&#34; I mumbled, feeling a bit relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, a part of me still hoped that the deep cut on my lip and the red and swollen bruise on my face would have lasted a bit longer to scare off bullies at least so that I can get through school today easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After standing still for a couple of seconds just staring at my reflection and realizing how pathetic I am, I lost control of my emotions and suddenly burst into tears, sobbing so terribly that snot was coming out of my nostrils, and I had to sniff them back constantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an ugly scene and I looked like a mess. Yet, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to stop like I wanted to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a while, but I finally got control back,  suppressed my emotions, and dried my face with a couple of paper towels. Then I took off my sweater and wore the blazer before leaving the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It shocked me to see the guy whose blazer I was wearing, standing in the hallway almost like he was waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I believed that he was for a moment. But when our eyes locked, he suddenly walked off, leaving me gazing after him in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Did he hear me crying my eyes out in the bathroom?&#39; I nervously thought, still staring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt humiliating to have such a thought in my head when I suddenly recalled that he was an alpha. But what was even more embarrassing was knowing that he heard me cry because I was an ugly crier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my eyes fixed on his broad back, I began walking after him, leaving a distance between us since I didn&#39;t want him to think of me as some freak who&#39;s stalking him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even though I felt a bit uneasy that he and I were heading in the same direction, I couldn&#39;t turn around because that was the hallway that led to my class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of us being in the same room felt a bit eerie and exciting at the same time for some unknown reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After following him for a while, I suddenly stopped, and my face grew pale as I dug my nails into my palm while watching him enter my class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;There&#39;s no way he&#39;s a student here and we have a class together!&#39; I thought, staring blankly at the door shutting close after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took quite a while for me to get over the nervousness that I felt, and when I finally overcame it, I approached the door and walked into the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my focus solely on the tiles, I made my way to a desk in the back row. Then I sat down, keeping my head bent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence in the room, I finally heard, &#34;Hello, everyone. I&#39;m Nero Fang, and I&#39;m your new instructor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing felt surreal like this moment as I gazed at him and screamed in my head, &#39;He&#39;s my teacher?!&#39;</p>
