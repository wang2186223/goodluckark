                <p>Bayoán&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in his life Abuelo&#39;s letting his father have a taste of his anger and frustration. When I look into my own son&#39;s emerald eyes and inhale his scent... Now understanding why Izzy in her most depressed state would hide herself with the pups... She could smell the soothing scent of her mate, the scent of our ancestors and hope for the future. I can&#39;t imagine Dad dismissing something like this, I can&#39;t even imagine him calling any of us a simpleton or talk in a demeaning way. He would TOTALLY have a laugh at the expense of any of us, but it was never malicious and we certainly never had to have our heads bowed in submission in front of him! That we mostly saved for Mom and even then she would just start laughing knowing we we&#39;re just bullshiting her. The dynamics in this family are very different... Still, I haven&#39;t seen abuse anywhere close enough to merit an investigation, just a grumpy old man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Just so you know, I&#39;m missing Dad like crazy.&#39; I have been working things out with Nina, it&#39;s been ok so far, I feel her commitment through our Bond. It&#39;s really nice feeling like I have my big sister back!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Yeah no shit! I could go for his fucking NAGGING before a mission right about now!&#39; Izzy thinks it&#39;s time the Guerrero family had a new Head of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Will you two SHUT it! This isn&#39;t about US right this second!&#39; Maco&#39;s feeling even more conflicted. On our way to this office we walked through a good portion of the estate and Abuelo showed us a picture of when he was young... He looked IDENTICAL to Maco. He&#39;s not been in a good mood since. Dad would always dedicate a LOT of time on Maco, and he would tag team with Mom. We linked the picture to the others and we have concluded that Mom and Dad had a feeling that Maco could be used as Abuelo was, so they kept a close eye on him until they saw that he wasn&#39;t a kid and much less a pushover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maco&#39;s always been chill, but his training is mostly in close combat and stealth assassination, he used to beat me to a pulp when we trained as pups and still today his eyes ALWAYS find an opening. He did train at OPIA with Víctor and his brother Vicente... And once he was close enough to you, it was your end. He only would use Ada and Obe: Two 17th century ornate iron daggers from Germany with a double-edge and a prominent midrib running down the length of one side, ending at a rectangular ricasso. They have cross guards that have a central engraved heart motif and short arms that extend from both sides with diamond-shaped tubular knobs. And to finish a spiraling wooden inlay and a twisting wire covers the length of the hilt, ending at the circular pommel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yacahüey found them on a French ship and after making sure that they were engraved and were protected, he always carried them in a shoulder holster concealed under his coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maco studied the Beta fighting style and how Yacahüey would use them in close quarter combat, the man never stops training and has asked Ura to train him, Amelia and Nía more with the bow. It&#39;s also always good when he watches you train, the second he sees ANY opening he&#39;ll stop you and help you change your tactic before it becomes a bad habit. In spite of everything... We were raised by our parents and Tía to BACK each other up and I have to give it to Maco and Izzy, this was a very good move. And now that I see the Guerreros I feel pretty good about our family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the evidence is fake then someone tampered with the DNA samples! How could this happen? Mijo, I&#39;m so sorry, but put yourself in my place! You named SEVERAL ladies of powerful families AND LUNA BEATRIZ! I investigated, but who was I to challenge the LUNA? What do you think would have happened to our house, to our family? Cacique may I sit mija? Let&#39;s talk, Alpha to Alpha, yes?&#34; She looked at him deadpan, Abuelo just scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, everyone please sit. We are family and BLOOD after all.&#34; She finally said and they gave a sigh of relief. She&#39;s open to listen, she may be a pain in my ass sometimes but she&#39;s pretty reasonable and diplomacy is one of her strengths. We sometimes jump to conclusions without the WHOLE story and we have learned that classifying things in black and white is unrealistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, are you saying that you&#39;re willing to change your genetic coding record and accept OUR blood in YOUR linage?! You would openly disclose our ancestry and acknowledge US as your kin? You would say Orocobix is your grandfather?&#34; This is quite taboo, we are the ruling class challenging the old ways and deciding to change certain aspects that are outdated that allow this corruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. However I have... Conditions... You know, to make a smooth transition within the power dynamic of the pack. You understand business am I right Don Juan?&#34; Atta girl! Straight to it... Both Izzy and Nina have impressed the fuck out of me with their know how of money and how to make profit. Turns out that all the potheads from the Circle had invested all of their money in different ventures, including Maco&#39;s company, and were living off the dividends. Víctor had set it up for them YEARS ago when he would still see parting clouds when he would see Izz... I couldn&#39;t roll my eyes enough back then! But the fact that the fucking stoners had a put their money to work for them was a little embarrassing to me! And it was URAYOÁN&#39;S idea! Víctor even set himself and his family up in their little scheme! And all they had to do was use the identities they use to get off Island and into the human world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A business woman are you mija?! I have heard and seen how truly splendid you are through the reports! The day you declared war upon The Council will always endure in my memory and now MORE knowing it was the seed from MY loins who achieved what you have so far! If the Mirabal family would acknowledge the Guerrero family as direct blood we would be nothing but powerful allies to you, you don&#39;t have enemies here!&#34; He stood and bowed to her. He bowed to Maco as Head of the family and me as Beta, he went to Nina and took her hand kissing it tenderly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear that you&#39;re the Master behind the new cities, I also know that you were a challenge to your father! Ha! I guess you can tell her where she got it from Cobix!&#34; The old man slapped his thigh laughing. &#34;Your great grandmother was a spitfire, too mija! I&#39;ll let your Abuelo tell you about it...&#34; We have heard the stories. Izzy caught it fast too so she pivots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Don Juan! I&#39;m not the greatest expert, that&#39;s why I brought Aymaco who is head of our family, Bayoán, your Beta and our sister Guanina whom you have acknowledged as a MASTER.&#34; Ugh! This is more fucking politics! It&#39;s hard for me and I was raised to handle it, Izzy wants to destroy a continent when she has to deal with it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mija, don&#39;t call me Don Juan! You&#39;re my blood Mi Reina! How about you keep calling your Abuelo as you are... I know that you would call your Bisabuela from Russia Babushka right? She was a though lady! I was with your Abuelo when we found her and little Alexander in that Goddess forsaken place! I helped him find Ivan and Verushka&#39;s corpses mija. I know you may all be angry at how I treated your Abuelo, but seriously... maybe I SHOULD have been more diligent, but I DID investigate them ALL Orocobix and you know it mijo! Why would I not take seriously that one of MY sons impregnated the Luna?! It was DANGEROUS for our family! And then for an ALPHA to be born! Why would I turn my back to that potential for MY family?! Loiza I already know your brilliant mija, answer me that! Bayoán! Not only are we the Alphas we are ALSO the Betas! Tell me mijo... WHY would an old man like me who has held on as long as I have let pass a ruling Alpha AND Beta of MY blood through my fingers? Answer me that Beta!&#34; I look at Izzy and her eyes go to Abuelo. Great grandfather did do the due diligence to investigate everything, however the system was to corrupt into itself and since it was several cases it was just not worth going into every single one. NOTHING is just black and white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s only so much influence you have until you start hitting red tape, and he IS right... they&#39;re not ruling class. They don&#39;t have the same access to information like we do. All of our lives we snapped our fingers and anything we ask is right at our disposal, they might have private tutors, governesses and Masters that live in the property to educate their children but usually the TOP of the TOP want to teach at The Fort. And we&#39;re the ones who are lucky enough to get that level of education. Izz and Nina take Abuelo&#39;s hands and Izzy takes a deep breath...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok... By what name would you like us to call you Don Juan?&#34; She&#39;s throwing in a white flag, she wants to negotiate, she&#39;s not here to start a fight with our new FAMILY that we are going to have to learn to adapt to as well as they to us. We are blood after all and we will have a strong alliance after this. The position of power that we are putting them in will grant them more access than they have ever dreamed of. And we all have to admit they have worked very hard for it, they have been training Alphas for centuries and are a part of the Legacy families who swore their lives. We don&#39;t joke with that spell... It&#39;s a Hereditary Blood Oath after all, anyone who even thinks of betraying if has already forfeited their own life!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My great grandchildren either call me Bisabuelo or Nonno! Our family hails from the south of Florence in the Tuscan region mija! Please, stay the night as our honored guests and call your siblings and mates! I have only seen pictures of the Alpha twins, I have four more nietos right?! I can&#39;t believe it Orocobix! Will there be an opening for the investigation of the others?&#34; Izzy looks like he slapped her around a little! We never expected THIS level of enthusiasm!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So would you be open to taking the title of Elder from my Abuelo? --- Nonno.&#34; By the Goddess we we&#39;re fucking holding our laughter! When we checked about our cousins father Alpha Franco we saw that their kids would&#39;ve called him Nonno for Grandpa most likely, when they referred to him had he lived and here WE ARE with it ourselves!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mija your right! It was hasty for me to try to forcibly retire a man such as him yet in his prime! Cobix, your still too young to be deemed an Elder, besides, mi Bisnieta needs a proper Alpha advisor besides her! Mija, your Abuelo will help you out with ANY complications and our family will back you. That&#39;s the hardest part of an Alpha&#39;s job, yet I have heard and studied YOUR strategies... Your father, may the Goddess guard his soul, would be very proud mija. I must confess, we ALL are, even if we wouldn&#39;t have found out about this, you have done so well! We STILL we feel the surge of the rush from our hunt on The Council! That has NEVER happened in all of my years alive! Never has the pack hunted in such cohesion!&#34; He looked like someone had gifted him the golden ticket! Orocobix had given him what he always wanted AND the Beta as a Bonus. It might sound really sleazy but it relaxes me to see that he&#39;s not hiding his ambition, it lets me know he doesn&#39;t give a damn who knows what he wants. I prefer sleazy honesty to backstabbing and he&#39;s not wrong when he says he gains much more with us as family than foe. Nonno or whatever is an old fox who knows how power works in the tribe, by Izzy recognizing him and his family, now he CEMENTS his own legacy into the history of our people putting his family in a position of ruling class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through our new growing filial Bond with them we can feel their pups exited to meet their cousins. The old man definitely wanted to give his family a place of power in the pack and he&#39;s a little rough around the edges but we can feel that he&#39;s genuinely happy to have more FAMILY, not just getting his unicorns with Izzy and myself. He sat Abuelo to his right side and his other sons were presenting themselves. They were curious about the reforms being put in and what did we recommend for they themselves to achieve what we are trying to do with our own family. When we explained they looked at each other a bit surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Loiza&#39;s not the Head of the Mirabal family, no wonder we were compelled to bow to Aymaco. Very odd choice indeed... Do you think that maybe we should do that mija? Who would you name as head of our family, which is also your family?&#34; Our Grand Uncle Yaureibo, our Abuelos oldest brother asked concerned in a gentle tone. She looked at me, we really hadn&#39;t looked in fully into ALL of them, they ARE a pretty big family, with several branches. They will definitely be a strong ally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Tío, Loiza isn&#39;t the Head of our family, she has decided that the path to greatness is lead by MANY, not one. She always was a gifted pupil to my father, but her favor and devoutness with the Goddesses ensures the power of her rule. So just as I have taken the mantle as her Beta, Maco will be the head of our family because of his inner serenity. We are trying to ingrain harmony in our Bond instead of power. You said it yourself Bisabuelo, we ALREADY have power... Yet it was harmony what helped us almost destroy The Council! So the Mirabal family is trying to achieve that harmony within itself. That&#39;s as much as I can tell you without betraying my Alpha, you understand right?&#34; They looked serious with a deep frowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do mijo... It does make a lot of sense... Maybe now that this thing will be announced I can finally retire and indeed pass leadership of the family to new blood. Cobix now that this is uncovered we can investigate the others! Any children of your body will be received by the family... If they want to, you know how these kids were raised, we can&#39;t FORCE anyone&#39;s love, I hope you don&#39;t forget that. I&#39;m sorry mijo, I thought you were enjoying yourself with the women, but having your children ripped away from you is another thing entirely. We thank you all for giving us a chance to restore what our family owes YOU.&#34; He&#39;s not just talking about monetary compensation. For our people, when a child is OWED, it refers to love, protection, education, linage, encouragement, status and preparedness for the future. Abuelo had gone to a huge hacienda door opened only at the top half that faced an open courtyard and grounds were we could hear children playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We can feel his yearning through the filial Bond... He never was able to see Mom, us or any of his children playing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always wished to listen to my children playing through Lobo Azul like you father... We know that&#39;s why you chose this spot for your study. Yes, I want those investigations...&#34; We&#39;re going to have to go through EVERY single person in the island to ensure the linage. FUCK. MY. LIFE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They informed us that our family was on they&#39;re way along with Víctor and Phoebe. They should be here in about an hour with the pups and the whole hacienda is in an uproar! It&#39;s being double checked by the new Alpha Guard led by Helena... That&#39;s one scary woman! Such a difference from who I met at Blood Moon, still a nice lady but I wouldn&#39;t have guessed what she would become! Freya wanted to be a part but she&#39;s to help lead the new mission with Ura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, mija, you said you wanted to talk business. Was it just that your Abuelo not be titled as Elder anymore? You and your family will bring great honor to our house and already four great great grandchildren! Two Alphas, I had heard that the Young Hunter had a Gamma daughter with his Twin Soul, right? VERY good, and you had a Beta young Bayoán! And your mate is a witch of the blood of Morgaine LeFay...? Impressive indeed...&#34; Abuelo couldn&#39;t stop shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously father?! They&#39;re going to acknowledge us as their kin and your fantasizing about how your linage will continue?&#34; Apparently our Bisabuelo is very pro mutations and to the Guerrero family that would make sense since they carry the very rare Lycan mutation. A few of the registered matings with more than one female are from the Guerrero family, two live in this very hacienda, so it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re children everywhere!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cobix, LOOK at THEM mijo! They are exquisite! My father eventually got what he wanted... The blood of Adelola mixed with his! Two ridiculous old geezers! My father just couldn&#39;t accept that she would never be parted from Imotonex. I was too young to remember much, now that we have a ruling Alpha we need to organize those records so the next Alpha&#39;s lineage is complete, whichever one of the twins will rule those documents have to be in Tip-Top shape! Guanina you know people at the Historical Society right?&#34; He definitely is rough around the edges but it seems that now that he finally has what he&#39;s always wanted its like he&#39;s getting ready to stand down and settle everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Bisabuelo, we&#39;re in the process of selling some items they have been asking for some time. Do you have any particular favor?&#34; He was thoughtful for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Several, but for now I would like to contract an Ancestral Master, I can give him access to our all our records and my grandchildren Constanza, Angelo and Alina can help, they are the ones that are in charge of all that, they can assist with putting that in order. Caguax, my oldest grandson will be at your disposal for anything needed, some have been digitalized, in this I&#39;m afraid Betas will always have an edge! Better organization skills.&#34; Our records never have been fully organized either, it&#39;s not out of the ordinary to have lost documents and diaries of family you didn&#39;t know you had. Ancestral Masters, help with verifying every document, certificate, blood sample, etc. And they have long waiting lists, especially when there&#39;s a baby boom, they&#39;re called to line out the ancestry of the children to come. We have to fix ours and we need THEIRS to be done by the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bisabuelo, we didn&#39;t JUST want to have Abuelo come out of retirement. You see we have heard that you haven&#39;t been able to sell Hacienda Florencia and we know that our Dad was interested... But the price---&#34; Izzy starts but he cuts her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hay mija, I put that price because Hacienda Florencia was our FIRST hacienda and it has the bones of many of our family, but Lobo Azul meets all our needs, and Florencia also has the village east of it, more inland. If you kids want Hacienda Florencia, I would GLADLY GIVE it to you! I bet Guanina will do it justice and bring it back to glory and since they are the bones of YOUR own and we could count on access for the Day of the Dead it would be best! I&#39;ll get the documents ready to transfer it and the village. Our numbers dwindled, so it didn&#39;t make sense for so much land, but I failed Cobix... I&#39;m sorry, but for fucks sake WHAT DO YOU DO to them them son?! NONE were your mate! And one thing is to impregnate a human female, that&#39;s simple! But a she-wolf without her Heat! It&#39;s VERY hard to achieve and you&#39;ve done it SEVERAL times?&#34; The old man looks at me still incredulous. &#34;YOU do the numbers Beta, how often does something like THAT happen?&#34; He DOES have a point, it&#39;s near impossible. Imotonex cried victory for impregnating his MATE with Cacicaná ONCE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Orocobix did it young, inexperienced, to older women, not his mates and by default not activating their Heat. With Isla as his mate, will her own fertility problems get in the way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father I told you myself that I didn&#39;t know how this happened, I impregnated the first woman I had sex with when I was 15! She just guided me and told me what to do. After that it started to be more fun and I knew what to do! Apparently word spread...&#34; He lowers his head blushing with a little bit of shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then they would give me anything I wanted if I did what they wanted... And more than once I was drugged.&#34; So it wasn&#39;t only Isla who raped him...</p>
