                <p>The door swung opened and my heart is hammering in my chest. But to my surprise I found nothing, just an empty bed. With no one around, I entered and check every corner of the room but found nothing. To my dismay not even a scent is left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did I really just imagine everything? I glance up, the moon was on it was almost instantaneously becoming a waning gibbous. So it means that during the time of the Arena it would be a full moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down at the bed, feeling it like I was missing something important but I couldn&#39;t quite put my hand on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay myself into this empty room, weirdly I feel comfortable in this queen size bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then finally sleep visit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ray of sunlight hitting me in the eyes, waking me up. I covered my eyes with my eyes then slowly adjusted to the blinding light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait? This is not my room. I hurriedly stood up then realize what happened and why I am here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit! Dwayne seriously?&#34; I pulled myself out of the East Mansion. Still having this weird feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should really avoid going here. This place is causing me to see things that aren&#39;t even there. As I walk downstairs the wind blew on the back door, was it opened before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way towards it and was welcome by an old garden. The garden was not in good shape anymore like the whole place was totally abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They did say this was the old place of the Royalties, this is particularly the second biggest Mansion in the territory and they just let those traitors live here and now the whole place is nothing but an old building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stare at the old fountain my head was starting to hurt, feeling my vision blurring. Until the darkness completely took me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surrounded by fifteen rogues, when I look around I was in the exact same place earlier. It was the East Mansion, but right now I don&#39;t know what is happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just want the girl.&#34; I narrow my eyebrows. What was happening? Who was he talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all started attacking me, trying to get inside but I have no control of my own body and started killing who ever tried to get close to the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done, the scent of vanilla caught my nostrils. That scent again, before I could even figure out who it was. I was already falling back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! Wait! I have to see your face! Let me see your face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up because someone is licking my face and when I look who it was, it was a fawn, a baby deer that looks like it was just about a few weeks old. Maybe they got here because the doors are opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by my sudden movement it started to run away. The head ache that I just had was now gone. I don&#39;t know how long was I asleep but one thing I&#39;m sure of. They were probably looking for me and by the looks of it was already passed noon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurriedly made my way back to the packhouse and just as expected. Sarah was waiting for me at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne? Where have you been? I was looking for you since I woke up.&#34; She sounded mad but I have no time for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah I was trying to check something. I will explain everything to you later okay?&#34; I didn&#39;t wait for hee answer and head straight to my father&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got in, he didn&#39;t seems surprised to see me. I have to know something about that woman. And one thing I am sure of, that she was connected to everything that I have forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was the woman that was with the Royalties?&#34; He froze at my words then look at me straight in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you remember her?&#34; He ask, I don&#39;t know why is that even important. I need to know who that woman is! If she was the one with the Royalties or not. I don&#39;t even know if I am going crazy or not. But I need to find answers!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad just answer me! Does she have black hair?&#34; This time he couldn&#39;t hide his surprised look on his face. Then turned to worry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know that?&#34; I ignored his questions. So I was right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was she the one who caused me to do everything I&#39;ve done before? Was she the one who brain washed me? Was that the reason why I keep seeing her in my head?&#34; I couldn&#39;t stop myself anymore. He stood up and told me to take a seat but I couldn&#39;t just relax and act like nothing is wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that was her Dwayne. And knowing that you still see her only means you are not yet completely out of her control.&#34; I was surprised to hear Hunter, I turned around and find him standing on the door. I didn&#39;t even heard him coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see Dwayne. This is exactly the reason why we need her back. Because the only way to stop her is by having her locked up.&#34; He added, J looked at him with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean lock her up? Was killing her means it won&#39;t stop?&#34; Wait? Why does I suddenly felt like I&#39;ve said something wrong. My wolf was also not liking the idea of killing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see Dwayne, she was reincarnated and if we killed her in that easy then she will just be born again.&#34; He explains, reincarnated? Was that even real?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will understand soon, but right now what you are seeing are probably her way of getting you back to her control.&#34; I don&#39;t like the idea that someone is controlling me. And if what they are saying was true then I have to put an end to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to get her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day of the Arena finally arrived. I glance around the crowd everyone had their own eyes to their warriors who wanted to join in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah clench my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really have to do this? You already know that you will be the Alpha.&#34; She muttered, then lean her head to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to do this Sarah, I need to get their respect back and by doing this. It will only show that no one is more capable than me to be their, your Alpha.&#34; I uttered, then pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Arena was set on the open field where the training grounds is. Then had a circular stage in the Center where the battle will take place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dale went up the Arena, he would be the referee, My father along side Hunter was sitting at the front part. Like how things are usually done the one who remain standing would get the chance to go against the Alpha. And if he won then the title would be his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay now everyone, I know you are all excited to see who will win this fight, and also we all know that who ever won would get the chance to fight and take the Alpha Title.&#34; The crowd was starting to cheer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like everyone is already ready, now let me first explain the rules of the game. This time there is no turning back, the fight would be a one on one combat skills. No one would be allowed to use their wolf, weapons are also highly prohibited. The one who caught using one would be automatically be a rogue because you won&#39;t be welcome to our pack anymore. Also the warrior will only be determined as a winner only if the the opponent completely gave up or die. No one is allowed to stop the fight, once it begin no one can get out of the Arena. I will still give you all a chance to at least give up when you notice that you might end up dying but if you still wish to continue and you actually died, the winner won&#39;t be responsible for it. So before we begin does anyone wish to withdraw?&#34; No one dare to speak a word after what Dale said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Withdrawing to a fight is not something the Crescent Moon is known for. All our warriors are trained to get themselves ready for every fight. And now that I notice all the participants who joined are only those who I haven&#39;t fought during the trainings. But majority of the previous participants are now gone. They probably know that I wasn&#39;t going to be an easy opponent for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck babe! Please be careful.&#34; Sarah whispered then kissed me on the lips before heading to where my mother is sitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance up, and it was a full moon. Indication that everyone are in their right condition. The full moon is where the werewolves usually have their strongest self. Because it was the time where the Moon Goddess was fully watching over us. It was believe that she tend to give us an additional strength as its light shines upon us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready?&#34; I look over my shoulders and found Alec. He keeps on showing up out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never been better.&#34; I uttered, then the first pair went up the Arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen you fight during the training and I could say that I was quite impressed by your skills. &#34; He mumbled, as we watch the battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope I could say the same to you.&#34; I stop then look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never watch you during the training.&#34; I added, the bring back my attention towards the two participants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember their names is Lewis and Luca. Both from the training grounds of the south. And I could say that they were quite skilled. Lewis was the red hair one who is much faster than Luca. But Luca on the other hand was much more stronger. His attacks were quite precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was quite hurt hearing that from you. But I wasn&#39;t surprised anymore. I know that you were always that arrogant Dwayne, feeling entitled and looking down at others.&#34; He uttered, I want to hit him so bad but I know doing that would only cause another trouble for me. So I will just wait until we had a fight at the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We both know who was the one looking down at who. You aren&#39;t even that skilled Alec. Zion beat remember?&#34; I said, then started walking away from him. I don&#39;t wanna waste my energy talking to that idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd started cheering, and Lewis was already laying on the floor. Are they really serious about the death thing? I glance at my father&#39;s direction but what caught my eye is the smiling Hunter. And to be honest it gives me chills all over my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our first winner Luca Derich!&#34; The crowd goes wild, while I saw some crying. Probably some of the relatives of Lewis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next is Peter and Tyler!&#34; Another two entered the arena while some pulled Lewis body out of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fight started and just like what happened in the first round one of them came out dead. I just stood there quietly, watching the number of participants decreasing each round. No one did gave up, probably not wanting to embarrassed their families. But was that even important than keeping yourself alive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For our next round, we have Gavin and Dwayne!&#34; This is the first time my name was pick. This is the first level of the challenge, what do I expect?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch my opponent enter the arena. He was staring back at me. He was also from the south training. He bigger and much obvious built than I do. The crowd was completely quiet unlike before. All eyes are on me as I walk towards the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you both know the rules, and don&#39;t even try to plan on doing anything because I will be watching you both.&#34; Dale then tap both our shoulders before he walks outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could give up now Alpha.&#34; He uttered, mocking me. I ignored him, I don&#39;t wanna end up getting too mad to the point thag my wolf would end up crawling out of my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BEGIN!&#34;</p>
