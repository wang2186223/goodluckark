                <p>No sudden gusts of wind. No growling echoes from the past. Just the weight of everything waiting beneath the surface.</p>

                <p>But Riley didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had waited long enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deeper they went, the narrower the passage became, the walls closing in as vines snaked through the stone, twisting like veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden torchlight flickered against the damp stone, casting long, twisting shadows that seemed to move even when nothing else did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere behind her, Lena exhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; she muttered, voice low but edged with amusement. &#34;This place just screams &#39;bad idea.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Lena was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a bad idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, she couldn&#39;t turn back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if she did she would never know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never know the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never know who she had been before they erased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never know what he had done to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was done living in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow chill slid down her spine, an ache curling behind her ribs, like something just beyond her reach was calling out to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like stone shifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran moved closer, his golden eyes scanning the dark. His voice was low, edged with tension. &#34;Something&#39;s down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s fingers twitched at her sides, her pulse steady, calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because whatever was down here, it wasn&#39;t just something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The passageway opened suddenly, widening into a vast underground chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center stood a massive stone structure, cracked and covered in ivy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she knew this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she had never seen it before, she had been here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in this lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees almost buckled beneath her, the weight of recognition slamming into her like a tidal wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a low whistle. &#34;Well, that&#39;s not ominous at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he could see it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The writing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faded, carved letters are etched into the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The language was old, older than anything that should have existed here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted, the words falling from her mouth before she could stop them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She who was taken shall rise again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the words left her lips the ground trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The torches flickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And from the far end of the chamber</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she wasn&#39;t imagining it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone was standing in the darkness beyond the tomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel his presence before she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow pulse of recognition burned beneath her skin, like a tether stretched too tight, like a memory just out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draped in black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden eyes burning like fire beneath the hood of his cloak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s entire body is locked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she knew those eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen them in her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen them in her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen them when he betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran moved beside her, muscles tensing, claws flexing. &#34;Who the hell is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hooded figure didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just stood there, watching her, studying her like he had been waiting for this moment as long as she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when he did, it sent ice through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it wasn&#39;t cruel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a long time, hasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was smooth, steady, like the ruins themselves had given him the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s chest ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she should have hated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have lunged for him, should have torn through him like he was the last thing standing in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because something inside her some terrible, forgotten part of her was still tied to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she didn&#39;t know how to cut the thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Betrayer&#39;s Name</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched between them, thick, suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack was still behind her, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was beside her, a storm barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But none of it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when she was standing in front of the one who had started it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley swallowed hard, her voice coming out softer than she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man tilted his head slightly like he was amused by the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse roared in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name clawed at the edges of her mind, tangled in the broken pieces of her past, aching to be spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had whispered it once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had screamed it once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, it came back to her like a knife through the ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caius.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she spoke, the ruins shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius smiled wider and for a split second</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley saw the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t just someone from her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was someone she had once fought for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone she had once loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And someone who had destroyed her anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of it hit like a tidal wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent so long chasing shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, one of them had stepped into the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Caius wasn&#39;t a memory anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he was standing right in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the worst part?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not of the pack behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not of Kieran, who was seconds away from ripping him apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that made Riley&#39;s blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have been afraid the moment she spoke his name, the moment she remembered who he was, the moment he saw the fury building inside her, the fury of a girl who had been erased, betrayed, buried in time, and left for dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was exactly what he had been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he had always known she would find him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he had never once doubted that she would come back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s hands curled into fists, her breath sharp and measured, her heart pounding like a war drum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say something,&#34; Kieran growled beside her, his golden eyes burning. &#34;Before I rip your throat out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius&#39;s gaze flicked to him, amusement flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy, Wolfe,&#34; he said, voice calm like he was speaking to a reckless child. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t want you to get yourself killed over something you don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran snarled, stepping forward, but Riley lifted a hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to protect Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To stop Kieran from making a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she knew that tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unshaken certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius wasn&#39;t just confident he was assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he had already calculated every outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he had already won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that meant one thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low growl rumbled through the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from Kieran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Figures emerging from the darkness, silent and steady, their golden eyes flickering beneath cloaks the color of midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Tobias&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that made the airdrop ten degrees, that made the ruins themselves seem to shrink, that made even the most hardened of her wolves step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in front of the ones who had come for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held his gaze, steady and unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be dead,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft, slow, like she had just told him a secret only he understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, calmly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So should you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck like a blade to the ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere in the tangled wreckage of the past, she had fallen, she had bled, she had lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here she stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so did he.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s breath came slow, measured. &#34;What happened to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius studied her for a long moment, and then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like a challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a ghost crossing a threshold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he had always been meant to stand here, in front of her, waiting for her to finally see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t remember?&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s nails bit into her palms. &#34;Not all of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius tilted his head slightly. &#34;Then let me remind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something cold and electric crawled over her skin, something that made her pulse skip, something older than memory itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran lunged, but Caius was faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers brushed against Riley&#39;s temple</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And everything shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Memory That Was Stolen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>White-hot, searing, all-consuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world was burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as an enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone she had loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone who had sworn to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet he had betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory unfolded like a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A throne room in ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of blood in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of wolves howling in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was on her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasping, bleeding, hands trembling as Caius stood over her, golden eyes unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words ripped through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tried to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tried to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she reached for him, the moment she looked into his eyes and saw the choice he had made</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife was already in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he was the one holding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision ripped away like a gust of wind tearing through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She collapsed, gasping, shaking, the ruins spinning around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius was watching her, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wasn&#39;t sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley staggered upright, chest heaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the fury inside her cracked open like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed me,&#34; she breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words felt foreign and familiar all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You left me no choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley snarled, lunging</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could reach him before she could tear him apart like she should have centuries ago</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new sound echoed through the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep, resounding howl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from her wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from Tobias&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly they weren&#39;t alone anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadows came alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A force too big, too powerful, too ancient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius had brought an army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to fight her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To reclaim her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this was never about killing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about taking her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley wasn&#39;t going anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not with the ones who had erased her before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not back into the dark, where she had once been forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse roared in her ears, every muscle coiling tight and ready, but Caius only watched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he already knew the choice she was about to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he thought this had already been decided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she was his to reclaim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley bared her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I belong to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius&#39;s golden eyes burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl ripped through the ruins not from her, not from the wolves behind her, but from Kieran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body was rigid, his claws extended, his breath slow and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have three seconds to get the hell out of here,&#34; he said, his voice a low snarl. &#34;Before I tear your throat out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius barely acknowledged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention was still on Riley, still steady, still expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand,&#34; he murmured, taking another step closer, his voice almost gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she knew what came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it in her bones, in the ghosts of memories clawing at the edges of her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t even the true fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was just the first move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the war she had been trying to outrun for lifetimes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had just begun.</p>
