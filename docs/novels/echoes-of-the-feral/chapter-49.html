                <p>She stepped forward, into the heart of the ruins, where the last remnants of her past remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stone pillars loomed around her, cracked and weathered, but standing tall refusing to fall completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Much like herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted her hand, pressing her palm against one of the ancient stones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shock of heat rippled through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins were trying to show her something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something she had forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something they had stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched as her vision blurred</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The banners fluttered in the wind, bearing her sigil, a crest she had not yet remembered but felt deep in her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streets were alive, wolves moving between towering buildings, golden eyes bright, voices rising in laughter, in unity, in power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This city had been hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a battlefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a graveyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A kingdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been its ruler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warrior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then she had been betrayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision twisted, shadows bleeding into the golden light, war crashing through the streets like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood on the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fire in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And standing at the center of it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as an enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes were wild, his blade drenched in something she could not yet remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been fighting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because she wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war had been decided long before that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she had drawn her sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she had spoken his name like a curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he had betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly, Riley understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This war</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had never been about winning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been about erasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erasing this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would all pay for what they had done</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision shattered, and Riley stumbled back, gasping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins were ruins again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the fire in her chest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was stronger than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was already beside her, steadying her, his golden eyes sharp with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you see?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw, her fingers still trembling from the weight of the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My home,&#34; she whispered. &#34;Before it fell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena swore under her breath. &#34;You mean before they destroyed it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;Before they erased it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they knew what this meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just about reclaiming land.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about taking back what should have never been stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time, they weren&#39;t leaving anything behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled slowly, letting the heat of her own power settle beneath her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face them, her army, her wolves, the ones who had followed her through fire and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t wait for them to come to us,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady. Final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We hunt them down. We make them pay. We remind them why they feared us in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena grinned. &#34;Now that&#39;s a plan I can get behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran nodded once. &#34;Where do we start?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned back to the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her kingdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her green eyes burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We start by rebuilding what they tried to destroy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled through the ruins, stirring the ash, and carrying the echoes of a war that had never truly ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley wasn&#39;t afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they had taken everything from her once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was taking it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the world would never forget her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled through the ruins, carrying the scent of stone, fire, and something deeper, something awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a battleground anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beginning of something unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stood taller, the fire inside her no longer a whisper of power but a roar, an inferno waiting to be unleashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves behind her weren&#39;t just a pack anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were an army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were the ones who would fight beside her, who would bleed beside her, who would burn the world down beside her if she asked them to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the war was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had never truly ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time, she was the one who would decide how it ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped closer, his golden eyes steady, his body coiled like a wolf ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really plan to rebuild this place?&#34; he asked, his voice quieter now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not doubtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley looked at the ruins again, feeling them in her bones, in her blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t plan to,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she meant it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place had been stolen from her, its name stripped from history, its queen erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But history had made a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, she was reclaiming everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A kingdom meant to rise again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves moved into the ruins, their eyes scanning the broken stone, the shattered archways, and the remains of what had once been a thriving city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere beneath all the ruin, beneath the layers of dust and destruction, this place is still remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It still belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it humming beneath her feet, the whispers of the past curling around her ribs, calling her forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just about revenge anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a sharp breath, planting her hands on her hips as she kicked a piece of rubble aside. &#34;So what, we just start stacking bricks and hope for the best?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley huffed a quiet laugh, but her eyes never left the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was calm, certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We build something they can never tear down again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena smirked. &#34;That&#39;s the kind of attitude I like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s gaze never left Riley, his expression unreadable. &#34;And when will they come for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not if.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had erased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had rewritten history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who still believed they could control the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned to face them all, the wolves who had chosen her, the soldiers who would fight with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack that had become hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we show them,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, wicked grin curled across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We show them why they were afraid of me in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night stretched long and dark over the ruins, the stars above distant and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the fire in Riley&#39;s chest burned hotter than the sky itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had walked through blood and shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had risen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she would make sure no one ever forgot her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the ones who still thought they controlled history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the world itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she was not done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just getting started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war had been waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was ready to claim it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire in her veins pulsed with every heartbeat, a slow, steady drum of something ancient, powerful, and unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent too long searching for the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too long questioning who she was, who she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the mistake they could never correct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war they had tried to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruler they had tried to erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was coming for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned back to the ruins, letting her fingers skim over the weathered stone, the once-great walls that had crumbled beneath time and war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But time was just another lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had tried to make her believe this place was gone, that it was lost to history like she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she could feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would bring it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As something greater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that could never be taken from her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the eyes of her pack on her, waiting. Not just for orders, but for purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had followed her this far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had seen the fire that lived in her now, the way the past had shaped her into something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t just their leader anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was their queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because she had claimed a throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had earned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena sighed, tapping a dagger against her palm, her sharp grin cutting through the tension. &#34;Alright, sweetheart. So what&#39;s the next move? Because I&#39;d really like to stab someone soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let out a slow breath, her gaze never leaving the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We rebuild,&#34; she said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena blinked. &#34;Like rebuild? As in, stacking rocks and playing architect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned to her, her green eyes sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. As in, we make this place ours again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena tilted her head, intrigued. &#34;And then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then we prepare for war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow murmur rippled through the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this wasn&#39;t just about revenge anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about taking back everything that had been stolen from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And burning down anyone who tried to stop them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran watched her carefully, his golden eyes unreadable, but Riley could see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way his fists clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way his stance shifted slightly, ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; he asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley met his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never been more sure of anything in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night stretched out before them, thick with possibility, with danger, with fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She welcomed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent too long being hunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was the hunter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the pack, to the army she was building, to the wolves who had chosen her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t wait for them to come to us,&#34; she said, her voice steady, unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t play defense. We don&#39;t hide in the shadows. We don&#39;t let them decide what happens next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled, slow and deep, feeling the power of this moment, of this choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We take this war to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena grinned. &#34;Now you&#39;re talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran nodded once, final. &#34;Then let&#39;s get to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the first light of dawn began to creep over the ruins, Riley didn&#39;t feel like a girl lost in someone else&#39;s war anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was at war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when the sun rose on this place again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wouldn&#39;t rise on ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would rise on a kingdom reborn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the world would finally understand what it meant to fear Riley Hayes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first streaks of dawn bled across the sky, chasing away the last remnants of night. But the darkness had never really been the enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been born in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forged by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, she would use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins around her stood still, waiting like soldiers holding their breath before the first strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel them, the memories pressed into the very stone beneath her feet, whispering to her, calling her back to a past she had never truly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place was more than broken walls and forgotten history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would make them remember that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack was already moving, their golden eyes sharp, their bodies wound tight with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they weren&#39;t just here to listen anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were here to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To build.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley watched them for a moment, taking it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How far they had come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much they had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much she had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once been nothing more than a girl caught in a war she didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was the one leading it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she had no intention of losing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena adjusted the straps on her daggers, glancing at Riley with that sharp, reckless grin of hers. &#34;Alright, fearless leader. What&#39;s the first order of business? Are we talking about strategy? Battle plans? Raiding parties? Because I have a long list of people I&#39;d like to stab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled slowly, feeling the weight of everything settle into her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was so much to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So many wrongs to set right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So many enemies to destroy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they could take the war to their enemies, before they could tear down the ones who had erased her from history, they needed to reclaim something first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their foundation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, letting her gaze sweep over the ruins, the crumbling remains of something that had once stood unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would make it unshakable again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This city isn&#39;t dead,&#34; Riley said, voice steady, carrying over the morning wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was stolen from us. Just like our names. Just like our past. Just like our future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the pack, to the ones who had followed her through the fire, through the blood, through the betrayals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We take it back. We make it ours again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves stilled, their eyes gleaming, their breath sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not doubting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her to tell them how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her to lead them into the next war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t just rebuild. We don&#39;t just hide behind these walls and hope they don&#39;t find us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers curled into fists, flames licking at the edges of her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We dare them to find us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s gaze darkened, his golden eyes locked onto hers. &#34;You&#39;re making a statement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them know we&#39;re here,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them know we remember what they did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled, steady, unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And let them fear what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins would stand again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves would rise again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when their enemies came for them</p>
