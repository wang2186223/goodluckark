                <p>When I ran into the woods, my feet began to tremble. I tried hard to breathe thin air. The feeling of being deceived made me angry and wronged. My nose began to sour. Then I heard footsteps behind me. Isaac must have caught up. I turned my back to him, hoping that he would not see my red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay away from me!&#34; I shouted to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; He stopped not far from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw it all. When you were in the greenhouse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saw it?&#34; Isaac pinched his nose. &#34;Well, I am not ready to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you can tell me what happened between you and that girl?&#34; I forced myself to ask him calmly, but my voice was trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What girl?&#34; Isaac looked puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play dumb. You know I&#39;m talking about the owner of the greenhouse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked her to decorate the proposal scene for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to propose to her?&#34; I asked without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about? Of course, it&#39;s our wedding scene.&#34; Isaac&#39;s face changed from shock to relief. &#34;Ah, I understand. You don&#39;t think I&#39;m lying to you, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would I know? You&#39;ve been so cold to me recently.&#34; I looked at Isaac. &#34;You smiled at the girl and gave her a diamond ring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god!&#34; Isaac had an expression of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. &#34;I was going to give you a surprise. I asked the owner of the greenhouse to decorate the proposal site. She was very happy to participate in my proposal. And she wanted to see the style of the ring, that helps her to choose flowers for decoration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an awkward silence between us. All the blood in my body rushed to my face. It was too awkward. I was now an easily jealous woman in Isaac&#39;s heart. He was so busy but he still prepared a surprise for me. I followed him like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t doubt you.&#34; My ears were burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac saw my embarrassment and hugged me. &#34;You are so cute. I thought I would be the only one who gets jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed the back of his hand against my cheek. &#34;I know you have a shadow of this kind of thing. It&#39;s actually all my fault.&#34; He took out a small, velvet box from his pocket. &#34;There is no surprise now, but the flowers I ordered can be used for the wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac knelt down on one knee in front of me. His honey-colored eyes looked at me affectionately. &#34;Claudia, will you marry me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I do.&#34; I had been looking forward to this moment since I was a little girl. When I was a slave, I hoped that someone who truly loved me would accept me and protect me. Now I met him. My tears filled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gently put the diamond ring on my ring finger. I didn&#39;t want him to see my tears, so before he got up, I rushed up and hugged him tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said in my ear, &#34;Dark woods in the middle of the night. This is much worse from the proposal scene I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I don&#39;t care about these things.&#34; I buried my blushing face in his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. The one and only thing I want to see is your happy face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now we are going to prepare the wedding together. Do you want to go to the greenhouse and choose the flowers yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you won&#39;t talk about it.&#34; I punched Isaac in the back. He grabbed my hand and kissed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will hold the best wedding in the world for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s office had been flooded with flowers, cards, and all kinds of planning books for the wedding. I didn&#39;t have high expectations for the wedding. For me, the wedding was just a ceremony, but Isaac wanted every detail of the wedding to be perfect because he promised to give me the best wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pulled me toward him and sat between his legs. &#34;Come to see this.&#34; There was a long list of guests in his hand. &#34;Anyone else you want to invite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all. I will be anxious if there are too many people.&#34; I also sent the wedding invitation back to the coven. Miranda always hated this kind of occasion. I didn&#39;t know if she would come on the day of the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed to a name on the list. &#34;Isn&#39;t this Alpha of Crystal pack? How do you know him? He has never been in contact with other packs.&#34; This Alpha was very strange. He didn&#39;t form an alliance or become enemies with any pack, but his powerful strength also made him and his pack survive and rise among the many packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saved his daughter&#39;s life before. The child sneaked out the pack to play with and was almost caught by rouges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t told me this. I feel that your life in those two years was very wonderful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t tell me how you became a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you? A beautiful fairy godmother saved me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if you don&#39;t want to tell me, you don&#39;t have to make up stories for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I said is the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall woman walked in, she exuding a sharp aura, while I sat on Isaac&#39;s lap in a large hoodie. When the woman walked to Isaac, I unconsciously straightened my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, these are the wedding dresses we transported from all over the world.&#34; The woman pointed to the dozen of large boxes that had been carried in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try them?&#34; Isaac said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now? I haven&#39;t even combed my hair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. Lilith is an excellent stylist.&#34; Isaac nodded to the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next few hours, I was like a Barbie doll at the mercy of others. Lilith brought an entire styling team, and six people decorated my body at the same time. My hair was made into perfect wavy arcs that scattered to the side, and then she stuffed me into a silk wedding dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it?&#34; Lilith asked me. &#34;This wedding dress is the famous brand Blueblood of Spain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched the fine lace on the wedding dress. I looked at myself in the mirror and was still dazed. Finally, the wedding felt real to me. I wanted to appear in front of Isaac in the most beautiful appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I perked up and said to Lilith, &#34;I&#39;m not very satisfied. The end of this dress is too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilith didn&#39;t treat me with a condescending attitude anymore. &#34;That&#39;s it. I hate people who treat their weddings casually. This is clearly the most meaningful thing in the world.&#34; She dragged me to the styling room and shouted to her team, &#34;Come on, let&#39;s change another set.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t this a bit ordinary?&#34; I looked in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The style is different. The Paris designer pays more attention to fashion. So what do you like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I hope Isaac will like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; Lilith covered her chest. &#34;Alpha had said the same thing. He only hoped that you would like it.&#34; Lilith pushed me to the styling room again. &#34;I am going to take out my trump card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was very grateful to Lilith. She would help me change my style every time. In order to save time, I wanted to change into a wedding dress directly. However, Lilith told me not to question her profession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilith brought me to the mirror. &#34;How about this? The royal wedding&#39;s favorite. An old brand with a hundred years of history in Italy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how to describe it. This was the wedding dress in my dream. It was a pure white dream, a synonym for elegance and romance. I touched the jewelry on the veil. &#34;This is too dazzling. I&#39;m not sure if I can wear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It suits you very well. It will make your eyes more beautiful.&#34; Lilith pulled me and said to her team member, &#34;Remember every detail of this style, every detail!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anticipation and nervousness filled my heart. Lilith magnified my expectations for the wedding. I finally knew why Isaac wanted to control every detail of the wedding. It meant that he was also very nervous. I changed the wedding dress and found Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it? If you don&#39;t like it, let them bring some more.&#34; Isaac asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need. I have already chosen the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am looking forward to it,&#34; Isaac said to me. He had more than a dozen wedding plans in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the proposal from him. &#34;I was also nervous about the wedding, but you were a little anxious. You know the most important thing to me is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I just hope you can be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m already very happy. I have the most beautiful wedding dress in the world and the most handsome Alpha.&#34; I sat on Isaac&#39;s lap, one hand around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow was the wedding. Isaac&#39;s men had already planned how to get him drunk. Before he was carried away by his men, he said to me in a very serious tone, &#34;You are not allowed to call strippers. Of course, I won&#39;t let them do it.&#34; Then I heard a group of men wailing regretfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is definitely the most boring single party!&#34; His subordinates protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never wanted to hold a single party!&#34; Isaac held his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna, help us!&#34; One of his men came up to me and said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Isaac&#39;s character. Even if you call a stripper here, he will scare her away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s men could only shout for him to drink all the wine in the store, and I saw someone I did not expect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miranda? Why are you here?&#34; The witch in front of me had long black hair scattered behind her, and her purple eyes were as cold as before.</p>
