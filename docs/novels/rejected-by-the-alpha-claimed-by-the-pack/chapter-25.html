                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, I was camping in the forest. In the distance, there was a pretty large pack. There were also a few rouge groups. This pack had nothing to investigate. They were not half as strong as our pack. The only thing I was worried about was the White Claw pack. Our stupid Alpha didn&#39;t listen to my advice at all. I hoped his luck was good enough and the White Claw pack would give up on attacking us. Late at night, a group of rouge stared at my team. They thought they had launched a surprise attack, but Caesar had already smelled the stench on their bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut the throat of the enemy boss with my saber. It was too weak. I didn&#39;t need to shift to fight with him at all. But his blood splashed on my coat. The blood was still difficult to clean up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, a messenger of our pack ran into our camp anxiously. He told me that the White Claw pack launched an attack on us a month ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you tell me until now?&#34; Even if it was Alpha Andre&#39;s decision, it sounded too absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha didn&#39;t let us inform you. We have already suffered heavy losses. I secretly came to you because I received the order of Commander Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I will go back.&#34; Although this was what Andre deserved, the others in the pack were innocent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way home, the messenger told me that Andre wanted to negotiate with the White Claw pack. I guessed that he would tear up the agreement unilaterally because he was that kind of person. Then the messenger told me that the White Claw pack sent a beautiful negotiator. I almost laughed. It seemed that the White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha was stupid. Did he want to send a beautiful woman to seduce our Alpha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back to pack, I did not have a rest and found Andre. He and negotiator were in the conference room. The guards outside the conference room stopped me. I pushed him away and entered the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After seeing the familiar green eyes, I was shocked speechless. How could it be her? The great joy I felt almost made me cry when I saw her again. No wonder the messenger kept mentioning her along the way. She seemed to have changed a lot. The thin little girl in the past had grown taller. Her figure had perfect curves. Her straight and slender legs were crossed together. Her slender waist supported her graceful chest. Her black clothes made her skin look great. Her skin color was no longer as pale as before, but light pink wheat. The silver hair gently brushed past the elegant lines on her face. Those eyes were still as beautiful as before, but the gentle gaze inside had disappeared, only revealing a cold expression now. So beautiful. Now she could make every man in the world fall in love with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what happened to her in the past two years. I had been looking for her for the past two years when I was outside of the pack. Now she looked like a powerful witch. Thank you, Moon Goddess. I had been praying for her safety. But what happened in the past two years kept reminding me that didn&#39;t be too proud. Did you still remember how you ended up like this? I calmed down and forced myself to shift my attention away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Alpha. &#34;I already told you. Why didn&#39;t you inform me about the war?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My men can win. We don&#39;t need you.&#34; He still refused to admit defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then did you win? An Alpha even wants to negotiate with his enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When is it your turn to speak here? Get out!&#34; He was angry because of shame and hatred for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, don&#39;t come back to beg me when there is a war.&#34; Before I left, I glanced at Claudia again. She sat there quietly. The quarrel between Alpha and I did not affect her mood at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre let out an angry gasp behind me, as well as the sound of something heavy falling to the ground. He might have kicked a chair, but I didn&#39;t care about this. I only thanked Moon Goddess for bringing Claudia back to my side again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the bed in my room, constantly rubbing the silver ring on my index finger with my thumb. Claudia gave it to me, the most important treasure she had before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She comes back now! Let&#39;s go and get her back.&#34; After Claudia came back, Caesar became excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t. I hurt her heart badly two years ago, and I am no longer the future Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Coward, it&#39;s not the problem. If you want it, go and snatch it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I will.&#34; I clenched my fists. There was nothing that could stop me. These two years, I walked out of hell by stepping on other people&#39;s corpses. I would not lose her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beautifully decorated dessert shop was surrounded by people. The crowd was discussing the negotiator who had just come to pack. I curiously leaned close to the crowd. It turned out that Claudia was sitting under a huge white sun umbrella to have afternoon tea. Our pack&#39;s girls liked to come here. They would sit on the long chair of the swing and joke in a low voice. However, Claudia made the shop look more luxurious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not have to discuss negotiations today, so she changed out of the witch&#39;s clothes and put on a French dress. The neckline of the dress showed a large piece of her creamy skin. Her long silver hair was tied up high by her. The soft right arm had a black bandage on it, which was made of crow feathers and fish bones, a witch&#39;s accessory. Her smooth shanks were crossed in the hem of the dress, which made her look even sweeter than snacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder there were so many people around her, and I only felt that it was harsh when they praised Claudia with words of praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were even a few arrogant guys who went to strike up a conversation with her. A wretched guy wiped his smooth hair, and I could smell the smell of his inferior quality hair gel here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to Claudia and asked her, &#34;This beautiful young lady, can I sit beside you?&#34; Listening to his deliberately deep voice, I almost vomited. Claudia acted as if she did not hear him and did not give him a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s enough. I pushed the crowd away and sat on the chair opposite Claudia. I looked at the wretched guy. &#34;I don&#39;t hear clearly. Where are you going to sit?&#34; This sentence was not a threat at all. My aura did not even spread. But he was scared away by me directly, hoping that he did not pee his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the people around her again. &#34;Do you also want to sit beside her?&#34; My fingers tapped on the table. The impatient signal was conveyed to everyone. They quickly dispersed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Childish.&#34; Claudia finally spoke. Her cold voice almost made me unable to hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think they are noisy?&#34; I didn&#39;t expect Claudia&#39;s character to change so much, but I still couldn&#39;t help but want to get close to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but you are also very noisy.&#34; She pointed at me with a sweet golden fork in her hand. My situation became awkward. Yes, in her eyes, I was even worse than a passer-by. Two years ago, in order to protect her, I pretended to sleep with other women in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t say a word. A sweet smile suddenly appeared on Claudia&#39;s face. &#34;Then, goodbye.&#34; She left without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Isaac came back, the tension in the pack had eased a lot. They always talked about how we could beat the White Claw pack when Isaac came back, even if there was no need to negotiate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did these ignorant people think that Isaac was a savior? It&#39;s me! I saved their lives when they screamed and ran away. Those ignorant fools who didn&#39;t know how to be grateful. After Isaac came back, he only visited our mother. His personality was getting colder and colder. Moreover, he completely didn&#39;t put our father in his eyes, not to mention me, the future Alpha. I was getting more and more tired of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my terrible life was saved by Claudia. After knowing that the beautiful woman was her, I was not only surprised but also happy. When she was bullied, I helped her. Although it was Isaac who asked me to protect her at that time, I did have pity for this strange girl. Now she had attracted all my attention. Although my wolf did not admit it, I thought she was my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hoped she still remembered the time we spent together. It was not easy for me to ask her out and then bring her to the garden where I used to come with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember this place?&#34; I looked at her expectantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, this is one of the few places where I can read quietly.&#34; Her beautiful fingers touched the rose petals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pleasure in my heart almost overflowed. &#34;Your appearance has changed a lot, but you are still very gentle and quiet, which is my favorite appearance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia did not speak. She just looked at every scene in the small garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have anything new? For example, mate and something like that?&#34; I tentatively asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, how about you?&#34; Her tone was just an ordinary inquiry between friends, but my face turned red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I have been waiting for the person I love.&#34; My heart was beating wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia looked at me, &#34;Very well. I still had something to do, so I need to leave now.&#34; I didn&#39;t expect her attitude to be so cold. I quickly grabbed her hand and she looked at me with a questioning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I mean is, what do you think of me?&#34; In fact, I was very confident. I had the most outstanding bloodline and the appearance that was often praised by women. As for Isaac, who was most likely to compete with me, he had no future now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia smiled gently. I felt that I was going to succeed, but she said, &#34;thank you, but I still want us to be friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I, who had never been rejected, could not accept this result. &#34;Why? Am I not good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia only left me an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched the corner of my clothes. This huge drop made me unable to accept this result. Why? I had already done well enough. What else did you want? Isaac&#39;s face appeared in my mind again. It was all because of him. My hateful and perfect elder brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had received too many invitations in the past few days. Neil even asked me out. Originally I didn&#39;t want to care about anyone or anything about this pack. But Neil had helped me a lot. Out of kindness from a friend, I decided to meet him once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought me to a small garden. The memories of the past flooded my mind. Being abused and beaten up, and also suffering the contempt of the werewolves from the pack. During these two years, these memories troubled me like a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was immersed in the past, Neil&#39;s sudden confession made me unable to cope for a while. I politely refused him. I just felt so funny in my heart. If he really liked my gentle appearance, why didn&#39;t he confess to me when I was still a slave two years ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil was very disappointed after I rejected him, but I didn&#39;t have time to comfort a boy who was sad because of the failure of the confession. I directly slipped into the library&#39;s information room to see if I could find any clues about the real death reason of my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, I was walking on the road. The pack&#39;s people looked at me and whispered secretly. They no longer looked at me with that envious gaze two days ago. Instead, they looked at me with the most familiar disgust when I was still a slave. I casually read one of the thoughts. &#39;If she seduces me, I can&#39;t resist her either.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seduces? Who did I seduce? This was too unreasonable. I continued to read other people. A woman with a child looked at me. &#39;I knew that witches were all bitches. She must be a spy from the enemy and deliberately came to seduce our heir.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, now I knew who the other protagonist was. After continuous screening in the crowd, I learned the source of the rumors from someone I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jesse was one of Fiona&#39;s friends. Before I left the pack, Fiona once took her to beat me seriously. At that time, the reason she hit me was that I seduced Neil. It seemed that some things would never change. I knew that she just believed in Fiona&#39;s nonsense. Fiona liked to use these girls who were very stubborn about feelings. She knew how much Jesse liked Neil and how much she hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t let Fiona treat me like this. I was no longer the little girl who was bullied by her and would not fight back. So I went to find Jesse. She was very unnatural when she faced me. I looked into her eyes. &#39;Why her again? And she has become so beautiful now. What if Neil really likes her? &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should hate her, but she loved Neil so much that I couldn&#39;t help but sympathized with her. So I told her, &#34;You don&#39;t have to worry. I didn&#39;t seduce Neil. And I don&#39;t like him. We won&#39;t be together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Jesse didn&#39;t believe me. &#34;Do you think I will believe you just because of these two words?&#34; But I could read the wavering in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you can come with me. I will let you see the truth.&#34;</p>
