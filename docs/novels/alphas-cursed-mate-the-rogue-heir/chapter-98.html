                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening air was thick with tension as I made my way to meet Luca. My heart raced, both from the fear of what had happened earlier and the anticipation of finally sharing everything with someone who might be able to help. Finn&#39;s death, the accusations, the chaos-it all weighed heavily on me, and I needed clarity, answers, and protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The narrow path I took was shrouded in darkness, with the faint sound of rustling leaves accompanying my footsteps. A sense of unease crept over me, like eyes were watching me from the shadows. I stopped in my tracks and glanced around, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a grip, Lia,&#34; I whispered to myself, resuming my walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unease didn&#39;t leave, though. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and the cool night air seemed to grow colder. Suddenly, a hand clamped over my mouth, stifling my scream as another arm wrapped tightly around my waist, dragging me into the nearby thicket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, don&#39;t make a sound,&#34; a voice hissed in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounded wildly as I struggled against my captor, but his grip was ironclad. He pushed me against a tree, his face coming into view under the dim moonlight. It was Dean. My breath hitched in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean?&#34; I managed to whisper, my voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sinister smirk spread across his face as he held a gun to my head. &#34;Miss me, Lia? You should have known better than to wander around alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; I spat, trying to push him away. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;ve always wanted,&#34; he growled, his tone dripping with malice. &#34;You. But first, let&#39;s deal with something else.&#34; His smirk faded, replaced by cold fury. &#34;Do you know how tempting it was to finish you off along with Finn? But no, that would&#39;ve been too easy. I wanted you to see what happens when you cross me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit me like a freight train. &#34;You killed Finn,&#34; I accused, my voice shaking with both fear and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean laughed, the sound chilling in its cruelty. &#34;Oh, don&#39;t sound so surprised. Finn was always in the way, but now? Now it&#39;s just you and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, forcing myself to stay calm despite the panic threatening to consume me. My eyes darted to the gun in his hand. I had to act fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body and slammed my elbow into his side. He grunted in pain, loosening his grip just enough for me to wrestle the gun from his hand. The cold metal felt foreign in my grasp, and my hands shook as I pointed it at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay back!&#34; I warned, my voice unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean chuckled darkly, his confidence unshaken. &#34;You don&#39;t even know how to use that thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, he lunged at me. My finger slipped, and the gun fell from my grasp. Dean snatched it up quickly, his smirk returning as he held it up triumphantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that was cute,&#34; he sneered, stepping closer. &#34;But playtime&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I braced myself for the worst, but instead of pulling the trigger, he backed away. &#34;You&#39;re not worth the bullet... yet. But don&#39;t think this is over, Lia. Not by a long shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he disappeared into the darkness, leaving me shaken and breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to gather myself, my legs trembling as I stumbled out of the thicket. I had to get to Luca. He was the only one who could help now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally reached Luca&#39;s place, I was a disheveled mess, tears streaming down my face as I banged on his door. He opened it quickly, his expression shifting from confusion to alarm when he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, what happened?&#34; he asked, ushering me inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Dean,&#34; I said, my voice breaking. &#34;He followed me, abducted me, and-he confessed. He&#39;s the one who killed Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s jaw tightened, his hands balling into fists. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;He even had a gun. He threatened me... I barely escaped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. &#34;Listen to me, Lia. You need to go back home and act like nothing happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I exclaimed, disbelief and frustration bubbling to the surface. &#34;I can&#39;t just pretend-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he interrupted, his tone firm. &#34;This is bigger than you or me. If Dean&#39;s responsible for Finn&#39;s death, I need to handle this carefully. If he knows you&#39;re onto him, it could get worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip, torn between my fear and my trust in Luca. &#34;But what if he comes after me again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t let that happen,&#34; he assured me. &#34;Just trust me, okay? Go home, stay safe, and leave the rest to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, I nodded. &#34;Okay. But please, Luca... don&#39;t let him get away with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t,&#34; he promised, his voice like steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Lia left, I sat in my office, my mind racing. Dean. The name left a bitter taste in my mouth. I had hoped never to deal with him again, but now he was at the center of a storm that threatened to tear everything apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my phone and dialed his number, masking my anger with a carefully controlled tone. He answered on the second ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; I said, keeping my voice neutral. &#34;It&#39;s been a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end before he responded. &#34;Luca. To what do I owe the pleasure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you were back in town,&#34; I said smoothly. &#34;Thought we should catch up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean chuckled, the sound grating on my nerves. &#34;Is that so? Or are you calling about something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw, forcing myself to remain calm. &#34;Just wanted to make sure everything&#39;s going smoothly on your end. You know, no loose ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smooth as ever,&#34; he replied, his tone smug. &#34;But you already knew that, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair, my grip tightening on the phone. &#34;Good. Because I&#39;d hate for any... complications to arise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean laughed, a low, menacing sound. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Luca. I know how to handle complications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead, and I placed the phone down, my mind racing with plans and contingencies. Dean was playing a dangerous game, and I couldn&#39;t afford to let him win. Lia&#39;s safety-and the truth about Finn&#39;s death-depended on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, I needed to act like I didn&#39;t know anything, to keep Dean from suspecting my involvement. But behind the s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scenes, I would unravel his schemes piece by piece until there was nowhere left for him to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>141</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was silent as I made my way to the hidden room I had secretly arranged for Dean. I had to be cautious; no one could know he was here, especially now. Tomorrow was Finn&#39;s funeral, and the emotions in the house were already running high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally reached the door, I hesitated. Taking a deep breath, I knocked softly. Dean opened the door, his sharp features illuminated by the dim light inside. His expression was unreadable, but there was a fire in his eyes-calculated and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk,&#34; I said, stepping into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean shut the door behind me and leaned against the wall, crossing his arms. &#34;About what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;We need to come up with a plan to find out who killed him. Tomorrow&#39;s the funeral, and people are starting to ask questions. We can&#39;t keep sitting in silence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean smirked, his eyes gleaming with something that made my stomach turn. &#34;Oh, I already have a plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, taken aback. &#34;You do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over to the small table in the corner and picked up an object. It took me a moment to realize it was a gun. My breath caught in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This,&#34; he said, holding it up for me to see, &#34;is the gun that killed Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock coursed through me. &#34;How-where did you find that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk widened. &#34;I&#39;ve been... doing some digging of my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spun as questions flooded my mind. &#34;Who does it belong to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean took a step closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. &#34;Lia... and her lover, Luca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened. &#34;What? No. That&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s very possible,&#34; he said, his tone dripping with mockery. &#34;I&#39;ve got proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone. On the screen was a text message. I leaned in to read it, my heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia: Come to my bedroom tonight. We need to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words blurred before my eyes as disbelief washed over me. &#34;She knows you&#39;re here?&#34; I asked, my voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean shrugged nonchalantly. &#34;We&#39;ve been in touch. She reached out to me the moment she found out I was back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head snapped up. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me this earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think it mattered,&#34; he said with a smirk. &#34;But now, it seems like it does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, anger bubbling to the surface. &#34;So, what&#39;s your plan? Confront her? Expose her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet,&#34; Dean replied, his tone calm. &#34;Let her play her little games. I&#39;ll make my move when the time is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing. Lia had been hiding so much from all of us, and now she was involved in Finn&#39;s murder? It didn&#39;t add up, but I couldn&#39;t ignore the evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said, my voice hard. &#34;I&#39;ll be waiting to see how this unfolds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk returned, and he pocketed his phone. &#34;You won&#39;t be disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was unusually still, the kind of silence that made every creak of the house sound like a thunderclap. I lay in bed, the weight of the day pressing down on me. Tomorrow was Finn&#39;s funeral, and I couldn&#39;t shake the unease that had settled in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, I heard the faint creak of my bedroom door. My eyes fluttered open, and for a moment, I thought I was dreaming. A dark figure loomed near the foot of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34; I mumbled, my voice groggy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could fully sit up, the figure pounced on me, pinning me down. A strong hand clamped over my mouth as the other tried to force my face toward theirs. I struggled against the weight, panic surging through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it!&#34; I muffled against the hand, thrashing wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the room was flooded with light. I froze as I heard a shrill scream. Alina stood by the door, her face twisted in rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean!&#34; she shouted. &#34;What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean scrambled off me, but the damage was done. I sat up, disheveled and confused, as Alina stormed into the room. She didn&#39;t stop at Dean. Her furious gaze locked onto me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on here?&#34; I demanded, my voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little slut!&#34; Alina hissed, marching toward me. Before I could react, her hand connected with my cheek in a sharp slap that left my skin stinging. &#34;You dare bring a man into this house, under this roof, after your husband was murdered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; I stammered, still reeling from the slap. &#34;I didn&#39;t bring anyone here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really?&#34; Alina sneered. &#34;Then why was he in your room? And what&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked open one of the drawers of my bedside table. My heart stopped as she pulled out a gun-the same gun Dean had shown her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not mine!&#34; I cried, standing up. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen that before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Bianca, Jenny, and several of the house staff had gathered outside the room, drawn by the commotion. Their shocked whispers filled the air as Alina brandished the gun like a trophy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even try to deny it,&#34; she spat. &#34;You&#39;ve been sneaking around with Dean, plotting God knows what while pretending to mourn Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true!&#34; I shouted, my voice cracking with desperation. &#34;I don&#39;t even know why Dean is here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean, who had been silent until now, stepped forward with a smirk. &#34;Oh, come on, Lia. Don&#39;t act like you didn&#39;t invite me. I have the texts to prove it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood ran cold. &#34;What texts? I never-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could finish, Alina cut me off. &#34;Save it for the police,&#34; she snapped. &#34;They&#39;re on their way, and you&#39;re going to rot in jail for what you&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic clawed at my throat as I looked around the room, searching for someone-anyone-who might believe me. But all I saw were faces filled with suspicion and judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk widened, and Alina stood triumphant, the gun still clutched in her hand. The walls of the room seemed to close in around me as the weight of the accusations pressed down on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was trapped. And for the first time, I wasn&#39;t sure if I could find a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>142</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold metal cuffs dug into my wrists as the officers led me out of the house. I kept my head down, unable to meet the eyes of the house staff who peered through windows and doorways, their expressions ranging from shock to satisfaction. The last thing I saw before stepping out into the night was Alina&#39;s smug grin, half-hidden in the shadows of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind raced as the car bumped along the dark road toward the police station. The reality of the situation was setting in, twisting my stomach into knots. Finn, my husband of just a few days, was dead, and I was the prime suspect. The betrayal I felt wasn&#39;t just from the accusations; it was from knowing who had orchestrated this. Alina and Dean. They had been behind this from the start, pulling strings in the dark while I blindly played into their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived at the station, and I was ushered into an interrogation room with walls so gray and lifeless they seemed to suck the air out of my lungs. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare. A police officer with a stern face sat down across from me, flipping through a thick file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Cross,&#34; he said, his voice void of any emotion. &#34;Tell me again what happened the night Finn died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told you everything I know,&#34; I said, trying to keep my voice steady. &#34;I was in my room when I heard the shot. By the time I got there, it was too late. Finn was already-&#34; My throat closed up, but I forced myself to continue. &#34;He was already gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer leaned back, crossing his arms as he scrutinized me. &#34;You were married for what, a week? And now your husband is dead. That&#39;s quite the coincidence, wouldn&#39;t you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw. &#34;What are you implying? That I married him just to kill him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tell me, Mrs. Cross. We&#39;ve seen strange things. And right now, you&#39;re the only suspect we have. No one else had a motive or opportunity like you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, my vision blurring with tears I refused to shed. &#34;I didn&#39;t kill him. He was my husband. He-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your husband of barely a week,&#34; the officer interrupted coldly. &#34;This isn&#39;t the love story you&#39;re making it out to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silence fell over the room, thick and suffocating. I knew arguing wouldn&#39;t help. They were convinced I was guilty. But this wasn&#39;t just an interrogation; it was the first step in a well-planned setup. Dean and Alina had thought of everything, leaving me trapped with no way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hours dragged on, I answered their questions over and over, each word feeling more futile than the last. With every passing second, my hope dimmed. The only glimmer of light was the thought of Luca and Benedicta. They had to know what was happening. They had to find me and prove my innocence before it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the kitchen, fingers drumming nervously on the table as Jenny made tea. The silence in the house felt strange, almost peaceful without Lia&#39;s presence, but it also felt hollow. After all the weeks of suspicion and tension, the weight had shifted. And now, Lia was the one under the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you believe it?&#34; Jenny said as she sat across from me, her eyes wide with disbelief. &#34;Lia. Of all people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can,&#34; I replied, keeping my voice calm despite the flutter of nerves in my chest. &#34;She&#39;s been acting strange for weeks. Sneaking around with that man, Dean. Who knows what else she&#39;s been hiding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. &#34;Do you really think she did it? Killed Finn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the steam rising from my cup, letting the question linger in the air. It was a question I hadn&#39;t dared to answer, even in my own mind. &#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I said finally. &#34;But if she didn&#39;t, she&#39;s doing a terrible job of proving her innocence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, her face a mix of relief and guilt. &#34;At least we&#39;re not the ones being questioned anymore. For weeks, I felt like every eye in this house was watching us, waiting for one of us to slip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to agree when raised voices from the hallway caught our attention. We exchanged a glance and got up, moving toward the noise. Peering around the corner, we saw Alina standing close to a man I didn&#39;t recognize. He was tall, with sharp eyes and an air of danger that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is that?&#34; Jenny whispered, clutching my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, watching as Alina spoke in low, hurried tones to the man. There was something about their interaction-an urgency that hinted at secrets far deeper than we had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to find out who he is,&#34; Jenny said, a determined edge in her voice. &#34;If we know who he is and why he&#39;s here, maybe we can understand what&#39;s really happening. And maybe we can make sure Lia never steps foot in this house again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my heart thudding with a mix of fear and anticipation. Lia might have been taken away, but it was clear that her influence lingered. If this man was involved, then he was a piece of the puzzle that could unravel everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we stepped back into the kitchen, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the storm was far from over. Lia&#39;s absence had given us a reprieve, but it hadn&#39;t ended the game. And in this house, secrets had a way of rising to the surface, no matter how deeply they were buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and I exchanged a silent agreement: we had to be vigilant. If we wanted to keep our place secure, if we wanted to ensure Lia didn&#39;t return to reclaim her spot and tear us down, we needed to be ready for whatever came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the house was palpable, and the silence that followed was more telling than any words spoken. This wasn&#39;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>143</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived at Benedicta&#39;s house as fast as I could, my heart pounding. Her frantic call hadn&#39;t given me much information, but the panic in her voice was enough to send alarms ringing in my head. When I walked in, she was pacing the room, her face pale and her hands trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped and turned to me, her eyes filled with worry. &#34;It&#39;s Lia. I think something&#39;s happened to her. I could feel it, Luca. She&#39;s in trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words unsettled me, but I tried to stay calm. &#34;What do you mean you feel it? Have you tried calling her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve called her multiple times, but she&#39;s not picking up,&#34; she said, her voice trembling. &#34;Luca, I&#39;m scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately pulled out my phone and dialed Lia&#39;s number. It rang, but there was no answer. I tried again and again, but it went straight to voicemail. The unease in my chest grew heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, my phone buzzed with an incoming call. I quickly answered, hoping it was Lia, but it was Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny,&#34; I said urgently, &#34;where&#39;s Lia? Is she okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause before Jenny replied coldly, &#34;She&#39;s been arrested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Arrested? What are you talking about?&#34; My voice rose in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They think she killed Finn,&#34; Jenny said bluntly. &#34;The police came and took her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impossible! Lia would never-&#34; I started, but she cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Luca. All I know is that she&#39;s in custody now. The evidence points to her,&#34; Jenny said, her voice devoid of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which police station?&#34; I demanded, but Jenny hung up before answering. I stared at my phone in frustration and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Benedicta asked, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ve arrested Lia. They&#39;re accusing her of killing Finn,&#34; I said, my voice thick with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta gasped, her hands flying to her mouth. &#34;No that&#39;s not true. That&#39;s not true!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s not true, but they&#39;ve taken her,&#34; I said, running a hand through my hair. &#34;I need to find out where she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned to leave, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was an unknown number. I hesitated before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Dean,&#34; a deep voice said on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My grip on the phone tightened. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk,&#34; Dean said calmly. &#34;Meet me at the old warehouse on Fifth Street. You know the place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated. &#34;Why should I trust you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have a choice if you want to help Lia,&#34; Dean replied before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Benedicta. &#34;I have to go. I&#39;ll let you know as soon as I find out what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warehouse was dimly lit, the smell of rust and decay filling the air. Dean was already there, leaning casually against a pillar as if he didn&#39;t have a care in the world. His calm demeanor only fueled my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better have a good reason for dragging me here,&#34; I snapped as I approached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean smirked. &#34;Relax, Luca. I&#39;ve got answers. You&#39;ll want to hear this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not in the mood for games, Dean. Tell me what you know about Lia,&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean straightened up, his expression turning serious. &#34;Fine. Here it is. I killed Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit me like a punch to the gut. I stared at him, my mind reeling. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I killed Finn,&#34; he repeated, his tone cold and matter-of-fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying,&#34; I said, my voice shaking with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk returned. &#34;Why would I lie about something like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could stop myself, I swung at him, my fist connecting with his jaw. He stumbled back but quickly recovered, wiping a hand across his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feel better?&#34; he asked, his tone mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bastard!&#34; I snarled. &#34;Why would you kill him? Why would you frame Lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;I didn&#39;t frame Lia. I saved her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Saved her?&#34; I spat. &#34;You ruined her life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I saved it,&#34; he said firmly. &#34;Alina wanted Lia dead. She had everything planned out. I stopped her by taking Finn out first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, his words sinking in. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina saw Lia as a threat,&#34; Dean explained. &#34;She was going to have her killed. I intervened. Finn was collateral damage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, trying to make sense of it all. &#34;And you think that makes it okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s not about what&#39;s okay. It&#39;s about what&#39;s necessary. If I hadn&#39;t stepped in, Lia would be dead right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, torn between anger and confusion. &#34;Why are you telling me this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we need to deal with Alina,&#34; Dean said simply. &#34;She&#39;s the real problem here. Get rid of her, and Lia&#39;s name can be cleared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re insane,&#34; I said, shaking my head. &#34;This is your mess. You clean it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean stepped closer, his expression serious. &#34;You care about Lia, don&#39;t you? Then do what needs to be done. Alina won&#39;t stop until Lia&#39;s out of the picture-for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, my mind racing. If what he said was true, Alina was more dangerous than I&#39;d realized. But trusting Dean felt like making a deal with the devil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I trust you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m the only one who can help you,&#34; Dean said. &#34;Think about it, Luca. You don&#39;t have much time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I stood there for a long time, the weight of his words pressing down on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel Luca&#39;s anger long before I saw him. He was furious, but I didn&#39;t blame him. The truth I&#39;d just revealed was a lot to take in. But he needed to know the reality of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina was dangerous, and if we didn&#39;t deal with her, Lia wouldn&#39;t survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked away from the warehouse, I pulled out my phone and dialed Alina&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s done,&#34; I said when she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; she replied coldly. &#34;Lia is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>out of the picture, and everything is falling into place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, I thought to myself. But this wasn&#39;t over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>144</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the police station felt longer than it should have. My hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, frustration bubbling under the surface. Lia didn&#39;t belong behind bars, and I was determined to get her out. When I arrived, I approached the front desk with a steady resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to see Lia,&#34; I said to the officer seated behind the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer barely glanced at me before shaking his head. &#34;No visitors allowed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, &#39;no visitors allowed&#39;? She&#39;s my wife-&#34; I started, but he cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s under investigation, and Alina has put in a directive barring all visitors until further notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina. Her name felt like a curse. Her influence over everything was suffocating. I clenched my fists, anger simmering just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is ridiculous. You can&#39;t just deny me access-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not up to me,&#34; the officer interrupted, his tone flat and dismissive. &#34;Rules are rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the station, my blood boiling. The audacity of Alina to meddle like this only fueled my determination. Lia needed me, and I wouldn&#39;t sit back while Alina pulled all the strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in my car, I slammed my fist against the steering wheel. If Lia couldn&#39;t defend herself, I would have to do it for her. I decided to visit my lawyer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived at my lawyer&#39;s office, the receptionist informed me he was available. I didn&#39;t wait for an invitation; I pushed open the door and walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; he greeted, his brow furrowing at the sight of my obvious distress. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasted no time diving into the issue. &#34;It&#39;s about Lia. She&#39;s been accused of killing Finn, but she&#39;s innocent. Dean-he confessed to me that he killed Finn and framed Lia. He claims he did it to protect her, but I know there&#39;s more to the story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. &#34;That&#39;s a serious accusation, Luca. Do you have any proof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet,&#34; I admitted, &#34;but that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Dean said there was a gun with Lia&#39;s fingerprints on it, the one used to kill Finn. We need to find that gun. And we need to find the gun with Dean&#39;s fingerprints. That&#39;s our only chance of clearing Lia&#39;s name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded thoughtfully. &#34;If we can locate both weapons, we can start building a case against Dean. But this won&#39;t be easy. If Alina is as influential as you say, she&#39;ll do everything she can to keep the truth buried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care how hard it is,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;I&#39;ll do whatever it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer scribbled some notes on a pad. &#34;We&#39;ll need a private investigator to start digging into this. In the meantime, I&#39;ll begin drafting a motion to challenge the evidence against Lia. We&#39;ll argue that the investigation was influenced by Alina&#39;s personal vendetta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I said, standing up. &#34;I&#39;ll find those guns.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I left his office, a sense of purpose settled over me. It wasn&#39;t much, but it was a start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to Benedicta&#39;s house, the weight of the day pressed heavily on my shoulders. I found her in the living room, knitting quietly. She looked up when I walked in, concern etched on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina&#39;s barred anyone from visiting Lia,&#34; I said, sinking into a chair. &#34;She&#39;s pulling all the strings, and the police are eating out of her hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta frowned. &#34;That woman is dangerous. We need to be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, running a hand through my hair. &#34;I just don&#39;t know what to do next. The lawyer&#39;s working on a strategy, but it&#39;s going to take time. And time is the one thing we don&#39;t have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Benedicta could respond, Merlin came bounding into the room, his face lighting up when he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Luca!&#34; he exclaimed, rushing over to hug me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a smile, hugging him back. &#34;Hey, buddy. What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss Mama,&#34; he said, his big eyes looking up at me. &#34;When is she coming back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, struggling to find the right words. &#34;Soon, Merlin. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go to the park tomorrow?&#34; he asked, his tone hopeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could answer, Benedicta chimed in. &#34;Luca will take you to the park, won&#39;t you, Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, taken aback. Merlin grinned and ran off, excited. Once he was out of earshot, I turned to Benedicta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you say that?&#34; I asked, my voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer, her expression serious. &#34;Because I think Dean might come after Merlin. He&#39;s Lia&#39;s son, and that makes him a target. Taking him to the park is the perfect way to keep an eye on him-and maybe even gather evidence against Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her, her words sinking in. &#34;You think Dean would stoop that low?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean is dangerous, Luca. We can&#39;t take any chances,&#34; she said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll take Merlin to the park tomorrow. But we need to be prepared for anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I headed to my room that night, my mind raced with everything that had happened. Lia&#39;s arrest, Dean&#39;s confession, Alina&#39;s interference-it all felt like an elaborate game, and I was determined to beat them at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Lia. For Merlin. For the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grand hall was buzzing with tension as I stepped inside, the weight of the elders&#39; eyes pressing heavily on me. They sat in a semi-circle, their expressions a mix of sternness and disapproval. I clenched my fists at my sides, forcing myself to remain composed. They didn&#39;t understand. None of them did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina,&#34; Elder Marcus began, his voice deep and measured, &#34;we&#39;ve convened this meeting to address the matter of Lia&#39;s detainment. This is a werewolf affair, not a human one. The pack elders should handle this investigation, not the human authorities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes. &#34;With all due respect, Elder Marcus, this is my decision. Finn was my brother. I have every right to handle this the way I see fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Helena, always the voice of calm but firm reasoning, leaned forward. &#34;We understand your grief, Alina. Finn&#39;s death is a tragedy, but that does not give you the authority to make unilateral decisions for the pack. Lia is part of this pack, and as such, her fate should be decided by us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her fate is already decided!&#34; I snapped, my voice echoing through the hall. &#34;She killed Finn. The evidence is clear. What more is there to discuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Marcus shook his head. &#34;The evidence is circumstantial at best. A gun with her fingerprints does not confirm guilt. We need a thorough investigation conducted by our own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed, barely able to contain my frustration. &#34;And what will your investigation achieve? Wasting time while the culprit walks free? Lia is already in custody. Let the humans handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders exchanged glances, their disapproval palpable. Elder Helena spoke again, her tone firm. &#34;You are letting your personal feelings cloud your judgment, Alina. This is bigger than you or your grief. The pack&#39;s stability is at stake. If the members see that we cannot even handle our own affairs, they will lose faith in us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Without the council,&#34; Elder Marcus added, &#34;the pack would descend into chaos. You know this, Alina. We are the bedrock of this clan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their words stung, but I refused to back down. &#34;And what about my pain? What about my loss? Finn was my brother! Do any of you even know how that feels? To lose someone you love so suddenly and so violently?!&#34; My voice cracked, but I didn&#39;t care. Let them see my anger, my grief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Marcus sighed, his gaze softening. &#34;We do not wish to diminish your pain, Alina. But emotions cannot dictate justice. We have decided-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve decided?!&#34; I cut in, my voice rising. &#34;What have you decided now?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Marcus didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;We are sending a team to retrieve Lia. She will be brought back to the pack and held as a prisoner until the investigation is complete. Her guilt or innocence will be determined by us, not humans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest tightened, rage boiling within me. &#34;You can&#39;t do that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can,&#34; Elder Helena said calmly. &#34;And we will. This is not just about Finn. It&#39;s about the pack. The longer this drags on, the more unstable things become. We must act swiftly and decisively.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed my hands on the table, leaning forward. &#34;So you don&#39;t believe she&#39;s guilty? Is that what you&#39;re saying? After everything, you&#39;re still doubting me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Marcus frowned. &#34;This isn&#39;t about belief, Alina. It&#39;s about due process. If Lia is guilty, we will find out. But until then, she is innocent in the eyes of the pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their words felt like a slap to the face. I straightened, my hands trembling with barely suppressed fury. &#34;You&#39;re making a mistake,&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Helena&#39;s gaze was steady. &#34;The mistake would be allowing emotions to rule over logic and justice. This meeting is adjourned. The retrieval team will be dispatched by dawn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for further discussion. I turned on my heel and stormed out of the hall, my heels clicking loudly against the marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, I leaned against a pillar, breathing heavily. How could they do this? After everything I had done for the pack, after everything I had sacrificed, they still doubted me. Lia was guilty. She had to be. There was no other explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now they were undermining me, questioning my judgment, treating me like some grieving fool incapable of making decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pang of betrayal coursed through me. Finn had been more than just my brother; he had been my anchor, my confidant. His loss had left a gaping hole in my heart, one that I was desperate to fill with justice-or vengeance, if necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders didn&#39;t understand. They couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they would see. Once Lia was exposed as the murderer she was, they would all see that I was right. And when that day came, I would make sure they regretted doubting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>145</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lingered just outside the grand hall, my ears perked and tuned to every word exchanged inside. Alina&#39;s voice was sharp, cutting through the air like a blade. Her anger was palpable, her defiance strong against the elders&#39; authority. As I listened to their futile attempts to calm her, I smirked to myself. Alina&#39;s rage was a weapon, one I intended to wield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stormed out of the hall, I waited until she was far enough down the corridor before following her, careful to keep my steps silent. Her pace was hurried, her movements frantic, and I could feel the tension radiating off her like heat from a flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina,&#34; I called, stepping out from the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around, her eyes wild and bloodshot. &#34;Dean,&#34; she hissed. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer, lowering my voice. &#34;I heard everything. The elders are against you, and I know how much that stings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms tightly over her chest, her lips pressed into a thin line. &#34;They&#39;re fools. Lia killed Finn. I know she did. But now they&#39;re sending a team to drag her back here as if she&#39;s some innocent lamb. It&#39;s infuriating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, feigning sympathy. &#34;I can see how much this has hurt you, Alina. But you&#39;re not alone. I&#39;ll stand by you. Just tell me-what do you want to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, glinting with a dangerous light. &#34;I want her to suffer. I want her to feel what Finn felt. And when she&#39;s broken and begging for mercy, then maybe I&#39;ll feel fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said with a slow smile. &#34;That&#39;s a clear goal. Revenge. It&#39;s simpler than justice and far more satisfying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed as she looked at me, and for a moment, I thought she&#39;d question my intentions. Instead, she said, &#34;Do you have a plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer, lowering my voice even more. &#34;The moonlight party is coming up. You know about the auction, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, curiosity flickering across her face. &#34;What about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every year, women in masks are auctioned off to the highest bidder, and the werewolf who wins gets to take the most beautiful one home. It&#39;s tradition. This year, I&#39;ll make sure Lia is one of those women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a cruel smile. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued, my voice filled with a sinister edge. &#34;I&#39;ll rig the auction. I&#39;ll make sure she ends up with someone ruthless, a werewolf who has no mercy. Once the auction is over, I&#39;ll strike a deal with him. He&#39;ll make sure Lia is gone-forever. Within two days, she&#39;ll be nothing but a memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s smile widened, her eyes gleaming with approval. &#34;And how do you plan to pull this off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s simple,&#34; I said. &#34;We&#39;ll need the elders&#39; approval to bring Lia back first. They&#39;ll think you&#39;ve given in to their demands, but in reality, you&#39;re just setting the stage for her downfall. Once she&#39;s back, I&#39;ll handle the rest. You&#39;ll just need to sit back and watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed, a sound filled with bitterness and satisfaction. &#34;Dean, you&#39;re a genius. This is exactly what I need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, pleased with her response. &#34;Good. But I&#39;ll need your full support. This plan requires precision, and I can&#39;t do it alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have my support,&#34; she said without hesitation. &#34;Do whatever you need to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned closer, my voice a low whisper. &#34;Trust me, Alina. Lia won&#39;t live to see another moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed a hand on my shoulder, her grip firm. &#34;Make it happen. Whatever it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned on her heel and strode down the corridor, her anger now tempered by purpose. I watched her go, a sense of satisfaction settling over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, all the pieces were in place. Lia&#39;s fate was sealed. The only thing left to do was wait. But first, I had another task to attend to-a loose end that needed tying up before the moonlight party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon hung low in the sky as I made my way through the woods, the shadows thick and oppressive. My destination was a secluded cabin hidden deep within the forest, a place where deals were made, and secrets were buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, a lone figure awaited me-a hulking werewolf with scars etched across his face. He rose as I entered, his golden eyes gleaming with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; he said, his voice a gravelly growl. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bother with pleasantries. &#34;I have a proposition for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow, intrigued. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a woman. She&#39;ll be at the moonlight auction. I want you to win the bid for her. Name your price, and I&#39;ll make it worth your while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed. &#34;What&#39;s the catch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The catch is that she doesn&#39;t leave your side alive,&#34; I said bluntly. &#34;Two days, that&#39;s all I need. After that, you can do whatever you want with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a low chuckle, his teeth glinting in the dim light. &#34;You always were a ruthless one, Dean. Fine. Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, satisfied. &#34;Good. I&#39;ll be in touch with the details. For now, just prepare yourself. This needs to go off without a hitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, and I turned to leave, the weight of the night pressing against my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I made my way back to the pack grounds, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a surge of anticipation. Lia&#39;s days were numbered, and soon, Alina would have her revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight party would be her undoing-and my greatest triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warm sun bathed the park in golden light, casting long shadows as children ran and played. Merlin&#39;s laughter was infectious, his little legs sprinting to the swings as he waved at me to follow. I couldn&#39;t help but smile, even as the weight of my thoughts pressed heavily on my chest. This wasn&#39;t just a father-son outing; it was a calculated move, one I had to carefully execute knowing that Dean&#39;s eyes were likely on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I settled on a bench near the swings, my gaze scanning the park&#39;s perimeter. Every rustling bush, every idle figure loitering in the distance, made my instincts flare. I knew Dean wouldn&#39;t sit still. He&#39;d either be here, watching or have someone else doing it for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin&#39;s giggles pulled my attention back. &#34;Dad! Look at me! I&#39;m flying!&#34; he shouted, pumping his legs to go higher on the swing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re doing great, champ!&#34; I called back, forcing a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone vibrated in my pocket, and I knew before looking who it would be. Sliding it out, the name Dean flashed across the screen. My jaw clenched as I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked curtly, keeping my voice low but steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, Luca,&#34; Dean&#39;s voice came through, smug and self-assured. &#34;I just thought we should talk. Man to man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back, my eyes narrowing. &#34;Talk? About what exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean chuckled softly, the sound grating. &#34;You know what this is about. Meet me, and I&#39;ll explain everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Merlin, his small figure illuminated in the sunlight, his innocence a stark contrast to the shadows Dean cast over our lives. My patience snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re watching me, Dean,&#34; I said, keeping my tone sharp. &#34;You think you&#39;re clever, following me around, trying to corner me. But let me make one thing clear-you&#39;ll never outmaneuver me. I&#39;m already a step ahead of whatever you&#39;re planning. So, if you want to play games, watch your back. Because the next time you call me, I won&#39;t just be polite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end, and then a soft chuckle. &#34;Touchy, aren&#39;t we? Fine, Luca. Have it your way. But remember-you&#39;re not the only one playing this game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call before he could say more, shoving my phone back into my pocket. My heart was racing, but I forced myself to stay calm for Merlin&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad!&#34; Merlin called again, jumping off the swing and running toward me. &#34;Can we go get ice cream?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled and ruffled his hair. &#34;Sure, buddy. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride home was quiet. Merlin happily munched on his ice cream in the back seat, oblivious to the storm brewing around him. My mind raced with possibilities. Dean&#39;s call confirmed what I&#39;d already suspected-he was watching us, waiting for the right moment to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived home, Benedicta greeted us at the door, her face lighting up at the sight of Merlin. &#34;Did you have fun at the park?&#34; she asked, crouching to hug him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Merlin exclaimed. &#34;Dad bought me ice cream too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta smiled and looked up at me. &#34;Thank you, Luca. It means a lot to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my expression serious. &#34;Can we talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood, immediately sensing the tension. &#34;Of course. Merlin, go wash up, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin ran off, leaving us alone in the living room. I sat down, rubbing a hand over my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean called me,&#34; I said without preamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened. &#34;What did he say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants to meet,&#34; I replied. &#34;But it&#39;s not just that. He&#39;s been watching us, Benedicta. Following me. Probably keeping tabs on Merlin too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. &#34;What does he want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;I don&#39;t know yet. But he&#39;s playing a dangerous game, and I&#39;m not going to let him win. I told him I was ahead of him, but the truth is, we need to be careful. He&#39;s unpredictable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows furrowed, worry etched into her features. &#34;Do you think he&#39;d hurt Merlin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, the thought sending a chill down my spine. &#34;I don&#39;t know. But I won&#39;t take any chances. For now, I want you to keep an eye on Merlin at all times. Don&#39;t let him out of your sight, even for a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, her resolve firm. &#34;What about you? What are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to figure out Dean&#39;s next move,&#34; I said. &#34;And I&#39;ll make sure he pays for everything he&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta placed a hand on my shoulder. &#34;Be careful, Luca. We can&#39;t lose you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, determination burning in my chest. Dean had underestimated me, but that would be his downfall. He thought he could play with my family, but he was about to learn just how wrong he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>146</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the keys jingling outside my cell sent a chill down my spine. I sat up, staring at the bars, dreading yet another interruption to my solitude. My life was in shambles, but at least here, in this cold, damp cell, I could think-strategize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up,&#34; the warden&#39;s gruff voice commanded as she unlocked the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed seated, narrowing my eyes. &#34;What now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have visitors,&#34; she snapped, stepping inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visitors. My stomach churned. No one should be here. No one who cared about me would dare come to this place. Which left only enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood slowly, letting my chains rattle as I stretched out my aching limbs. &#34;This should be fun,&#34; I muttered under my breath, following her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warden led me through the long corridor. Every step felt heavier than the last, the chains clinking like a somber melody. As we stepped outside, the blinding sunlight stung my eyes. I blinked rapidly, trying to adjust, and then I saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina and Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina stood tall and regal, her arms crossed, her expression dripping with smug satisfaction. Dean, on the other hand, leaned casually against a post, his face devoid of emotion, but his sharp eyes never left mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a short, bitter laugh. &#34;Well, well,&#34; I said, tilting my head. &#34;Dean, is this your new plaything? Or are you just following her orders like a good little pet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s face twisted in fury, and before I could react, her hand flew across my face, the sharp sting spreading through my cheek. The warden didn&#39;t even flinch; she just stood there, indifferent, as though this was a daily occurrence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You vile, conniving wench!&#34; Alina spat, her voice low and venomous. &#34;You think this is a joke? You will pay for what you&#39;ve done! The elders will see to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back, tasting blood on my lip but refusing to wipe it away. &#34;Punished for what, Alina? For existing? Or for standing in the way of your desperate need for control?&#34; I smirked, though my heart raced in my chest. &#34;Tell me, dear sister-in-law, have you ever stopped to ask yourself who&#39;s really behind all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut your mouth!&#34; she barked, her hands trembling with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my attention to Dean, ignoring her outburst. &#34;And you, Dean? What&#39;s your angle here? Or are you just here for the entertainment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean stepped forward, his presence imposing despite his calm demeanor. &#34;We&#39;ve got evidence, Lia,&#34; he said coolly, his tone sharp as a blade. &#34;Evidence of your affair with Luca. Even when you were engaged to Finn, you were sneaking around like the ungrateful little liar you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smirk faltered, but I quickly recovered. &#34;Oh, please,&#34; I scoffed, my voice laced with defiance. &#34;What kind of evidence? Fabricated texts? Staged photographs? You two are grasping at straws, and it&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned closer, his dark eyes boring into mine. &#34;The elders won&#39;t see it that way. You&#39;ll be tried, and when the truth comes out, you&#39;ll wish you&#39;d never crossed us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held his gaze, refusing to show fear. &#34;You&#39;re both cowards,&#34; I said, my voice steady. &#34;And when the real truth comes out, it&#39;ll be you two standing in chains, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s laugh was cold and hollow. &#34;Keep dreaming, Lia. But remember this: tomorrow, the elders will strip you of whatever dignity you think you have left. You&#39;ll rot in the pack&#39;s prison, and no one will mourn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to the warden, ignoring Alina&#39;s venomous words. &#34;I don&#39;t want any more visitors,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Not from them, not from anyone. Make it clear-they&#39;re not welcome here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warden nodded, her face betraying no emotion as she led me back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked away, I could feel their eyes burning into my back, their hatred palpable. But I refused to look back. I wouldn&#39;t give them the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in my cell, I sat down heavily on the cot, my mind racing. They thought they had won, but I wasn&#39;t finished. Not by a long shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the length of my room, my heels clicking against the polished wooden floor, my thoughts racing as I waited for Dean to arrive. Everything was falling into place, but there was still one loose thread that needed to be tied up-Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp knock on the door snapped me out of my thoughts. &#34;Come in,&#34; I said curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean stepped inside, his face unreadable, as always. He moved with a quiet confidence that unnerved most people, but I found it useful. It was one of the reasons I had kept him close all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called?&#34; he said, shutting the door behind him and leaning casually against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I replied, folding my arms. &#34;We need to discuss Lia. The elders are already meddling, demanding her return to the pack for questioning. If we don&#39;t act soon, this whole thing could spiral out of control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean smirked, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. &#34;You sound worried, Alina. That&#39;s not like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot him a glare. &#34;Don&#39;t test me, Dean. I&#39;ve come too far to let some meddling elders ruin my plans. Lia needs to be brought back to the pack-on our terms. We can&#39;t let her fall into their hands. They&#39;ll start asking questions, digging into things best left buried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded thoughtfully, straightening up. &#34;So, what&#39;s the plan? I assume you&#39;ve already thought of a way to get her out of that cell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I said, a small, satisfied smile tugging at my lips. &#34;But it won&#39;t be easy. The prison is heavily guarded, and the warden is no fool. We&#39;ll need to be careful, precise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean crossed his arms, leaning slightly forward. &#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I began to pace again, outlining my plan as I spoke. &#34;First, we&#39;ll create a diversion. Something that will draw the guards&#39; attention away from Lia&#39;s cell. A fire, perhaps, in one of the storage rooms. It doesn&#39;t have to be big-just enough to cause chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s lips curved into a sly grin. &#34;I like it. Chaos is always a good distraction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While the guards are occupied,&#34; I continued, &#34;you&#39;ll enter the cellblock disguised as one of them. I&#39;ve already arranged for a uniform to be delivered to you. Once you&#39;re inside, you&#39;ll escort Lia out under the pretense of transferring her to another facility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean raised an eyebrow. &#34;And you think she&#39;ll cooperate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t have a choice,&#34; I said coolly. &#34;I&#39;ll make it clear to her that this is her only chance to escape the elders&#39; wrath. She may be stubborn, but she&#39;s not stupid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And once we get her back to the pack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, meeting his gaze. &#34;We&#39;ll keep her under lock and key, out of sight. The elders can&#39;t question her if they don&#39;t know where she is. And once the Moonlight Auction begins, we&#39;ll put the final phase of our plan into motion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean chuckled darkly. &#34;You really are ruthless, Alina. No wonder Finn trusted you to handle things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Finn, a flicker of pain shot through me, but I quickly pushed it aside. This wasn&#39;t the time for sentimentality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t just about me, Dean,&#34; I said sharply. &#34;It&#39;s about the pack. Finn&#39;s death has left us vulnerable, and Lia is a threat to our stability. She has to be dealt with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded, his expression turning serious. &#34;Understood. When do we move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow night,&#34; I replied. &#34;I&#39;ll handle the arrangements for the diversion. You focus on getting that uniform and making sure everything on your end goes smoothly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean gave a mock salute. &#34;Consider it done. Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated for a moment, then added, &#34;Be careful, Dean. If anything goes wrong, it could be both our heads on the chopping block.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked again, his confidence unwavering. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me, Alina. I know how to handle myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned to leave, I called after him. &#34;And Dean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, looking back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure Lia understands that this is her only chance. If she so much as thinks about betraying us, she won&#39;t live to regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s grin widened. &#34;You&#39;re more ruthless than I thought, Alina. I like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he left, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I took a deep breath, steeling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>myself for what lay ahead. Lia&#39;s days were numbered, and I would make sure she paid for everything she&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>147</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was still, save for the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. I had been walking down the hall toward my room when I heard faint voices coming from Alina&#39;s study. Curious, I paused just outside the door, careful to stay in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about this?&#34; Alina&#39;s sharp voice carried through the crack in the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Dean replied confidently. &#34;Tomorrow night, everything will go as planned. Once the fire distracts the guards, I&#39;ll get Lia out and bring her back to the pack. She&#39;ll be ours to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. Fire? Lia? What were they planning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re certain the elders won&#39;t interfere?&#34; Alina asked her voice tight with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll have no idea until it&#39;s too late,&#34; Dean assured her. &#34;By the time they figure it out, Lia will be back here, under our control. Trust me, Alina, everything is under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my hand over my mouth to keep from gasping. Dean and Alina were plotting to break Lia out of prison. But why? And what did this mean about Finn&#39;s death? Could they have been involved?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t dare stay any longer. As quietly as I could, I slipped away from the door and hurried down the hall to find Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached her room, I burst in without knocking. Jenny sat on her bed, startled by my sudden entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asked, setting down the book she had been reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going to believe what I just overheard,&#34; I said, quickly closing the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath and recounted everything I had just heard. By the time I finished, Jenny&#39;s face was a mix of shock and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, they&#39;re planning to break Lia out,&#34; she said slowly, piecing it together. &#34;But why? And why go to such lengths if they&#39;re convinced she&#39;s guilty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to figure out,&#34; I replied. &#34;It doesn&#39;t make sense. Unless&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Unless Dean and Alina are the ones behind Finn&#39;s death. Think about it-who else would have the means and motive to frame Lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a terrifying thought, but it made sense. Dean had always been shady, and Alina&#39;s hatred for Lia was no secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to find out for sure,&#34; Jenny said, her voice steady. &#34;If they&#39;re going to the prison tomorrow night, we&#39;ll follow them. Maybe we can find proof of what they&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated. &#34;It&#39;s risky, Jenny. If they catch us-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t let them catch us,&#34; she cut me off. &#34;This might be our only chance to expose them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her determination was contagious, and I found myself nodding. &#34;Alright. We&#39;ll follow them. But we need to be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following night, Jenny and I waited in the shadows outside the pack house, our breaths shallow and our nerves on edge. We watched as Dean and Alina slipped out, their movements cautious but not cautious enough to spot us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re heading toward the woods,&#34; Jenny whispered, nudging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, and we followed at a safe distance, staying hidden among the trees. My heart pounded in my chest as we trailed them, every snap of a twig underfoot making me flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, we reached the edge of the prison grounds. Dean and Alina stopped, crouching low as they surveyed the area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here,&#34; Dean told Alina. &#34;I&#39;ll handle the guards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina nodded, her expression cold and resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and I exchanged a glance. This was it. Whatever they were planning was about to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean moved quickly, slipping into the shadows and disappearing from view. Alina remained where she was, her eyes fixed on the prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get closer,&#34; Jenny whispered, tugging my sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We crept forward, inching closer to where Alina was hiding. From our new vantage point, we could see Dean reemerge, now wearing a guard&#39;s uniform. He carried himself with confidence, moving as though he belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going inside,&#34; I murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded. &#34;They&#39;re definitely breaking her out. But why go through all this trouble if she&#39;s guilty? It doesn&#39;t add up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, my mind racing. &#34;We need to find out what they&#39;re planning next. And if Dean really is responsible for Finn&#39;s death, we need to prove it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stayed hidden, watching as Dean entered the prison and Alina remained on the lookout. My stomach churned with a mix of fear and anticipation. Whatever was happening tonight was going to change everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cell was cold and suffocating, but after days of sleepless nights and relentless worry, exhaustion finally overtook me. I fell into a restless slumber, haunted by dreams of Finn, Luca, and a sea of accusing faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the shrill sound of the fire alarm jolted me awake. My heart raced as the piercing noise echoed off the cement walls, a chaotic symphony accompanied by the distant sound of shouting. Smoke began to seep through the small cracks around the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stumbled to my feet, coughing as the acrid smell filled my lungs. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I muttered, panic creeping into my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could piece together what was happening, I heard faint but deliberate footsteps outside my cell. My instincts screamed danger. &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34; I called out, my voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footsteps grew louder, more purposeful until they stopped right outside my cell door. My pulse pounded in my ears as I backed up against the far wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, and through the haze of smoke, I saw a figure step inside. I couldn&#39;t make out their face at first, but their scent hit me-a distinct, familiar musk. My wolf stirred uneasily within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; I whispered, my voice laced with both anger and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer. Instead, he moved swiftly, covering his nose and mouth with a cloth as he approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I demanded, my voice breaking. &#34;What is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he said nothing. His silence unnerved me more than any words could have. I pressed myself further into the wall, desperation coursing through my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me!&#34; I shouted, but the words barely left my lips before Dean lunged at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ducked, narrowly avoiding his grasp, and scrambled toward the door. My hands clawed at the frame, but Dean was faster. His arm wrapped around my waist, yanking me backward with a force that knocked the air out of my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; I screamed, thrashing against his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t let up. Instead, he brought the cloth he was holding toward my face. A sickly sweet smell invaded my senses as he tried to press it against my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I gasped, twisting my head away. My wolf surged within me, giving me strength as I clawed at his arms. I bit down hard on his wrist, and he let out a sharp grunt of pain, loosening his hold just enough for me to break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun around to face him, my vision blurred by smoke and tears. &#34;Why, Dean? Why are you doing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer, his expression a cold mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I backed away, I sniffed the air, trying to confirm what I already knew. Beneath the stench of smoke and chemicals, his scent was undeniable. This was Dean. The man who had always lingered in the shadows, the man I had never trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed Finn, didn&#39;t you?&#34; I spat, the realization hitting me like a ton of bricks. &#34;This was all your plan, wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, and his silence spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury bubbled within me. &#34;You think you can frame me for your crime? Do you think this will make you untouchable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes darkened, and without warning, he struck me across the face. Pain exploded in my cheek as I stumbled backward, dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; he said finally, his voice low and menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could recover, he closed the distance between us, grabbing me by the arm. My vision blurred, and my strength began to wane as he pulled me toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smoke grew thicker, each breath burning my lungs. My head spun as I tried to resist, but my body betrayed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca will stop you,&#34; I managed to choke out, even as my knees buckled. &#34;You won&#39;t get away with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean let out a dark laugh. &#34;Oh, Lia, Luca isn&#39;t your savior. He&#39;s just another pawn in this game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cut deeper than the blow to my face, but I couldn&#39;t focus on them. The world tilted, the edges of my vision darkening as he dragged me out of the cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to fight, to summon any strength I had left, but it was no use. The last thing I saw before e</p>
                
                
                
                <p>verything went black was the flickering glow of flames in the distance and Dean&#39;s cold, unrelenting face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness swallowed me whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>148</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The acrid smell of smoke hung heavy in the air as I crouched behind a charred wall, the flames casting flickering shadows around me. The chaos in the prison yard provided the perfect cover as I silently observed Dean emerging from the building, carrying an unconscious Lia over his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t deny the small flicker of satisfaction I felt as I discreetly raised my phone, recording every step he took. The camera lens followed his every move-the way he moved quickly yet cautiously, his sharp eyes scanning the area for anyone who might witness his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect,&#34; I muttered under my breath. My phone&#39;s screen glowed faintly in the darkness, capturing every incriminating second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny was stationed elsewhere, tailing Alina. We had planned this carefully. Jenny would ensure Alina&#39;s actions were documented, while I focused on Dean. Every step of the way, we were one step closer to exposing the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watched Dean haul Lia out of the crumbling building, I felt a pang of guilt twist in my chest. Lia&#39;s limp form reminded me of just how far this had gone. She didn&#39;t deserve this-not all of it, at least. My past actions weighed heavily on me now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For weeks, I&#39;d reveled in the idea of Lia&#39;s suffering. I&#39;d convinced myself that she was the enemy, the woman who had ruined everything for everyone. But now, seeing her like this-broken, unconscious, and framed for something she clearly hadn&#39;t done-I couldn&#39;t ignore the gnawing sense of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay focused, Bianca,&#34; I whispered to myself. I couldn&#39;t afford to lose sight of the goal now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean reached a black car parked just outside the gates. He opened the trunk and, without a second thought, dumped Lia&#39;s body inside like she was nothing more than a sack of grain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip to stifle the gasp that threatened to escape. My hands shook slightly as I zoomed in on the screen, capturing the moment Lia&#39;s motionless form disappeared into the trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean paused, his head snapping up as he scanned his surroundings again. I held my breath, my heart pounding in my chest. If he saw me now, I&#39;d be done for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense moment, he seemed satisfied that no one was around. He slammed the trunk shut and walked around to the driver&#39;s side. I stayed low, my body pressed tightly against the wall, as I recorded him getting into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine roared to life, and the car sped off into the night, leaving a trail of dust and smoke in its wake. I exhaled slowly, relief washing over me as I realized he hadn&#39;t spotted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my phone, my thoughts racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just about helping Alina anymore. Watching Lia being treated like that-like a disposable pawn in their twisted game-had shifted something in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been so consumed by my loyalty to Alina and my own grievances against Lia that I&#39;d ignored the bigger picture. Dean and Alina weren&#39;t just trying to punish Lia; they were orchestrating something far darker and more sinister. And I&#39;d been complicit in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up slowly, brushing ash and soot off my clothes. I glanced at my phone screen, replaying the footage I&#39;d just taken. Dean&#39;s actions were clear as day, undeniable evidence of his involvement in Lia&#39;s abduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t confront them now-Dean and Alina were too dangerous, too powerful. But I could play along, pretending to remain on their side while secretly gathering more evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny would understand. She&#39;d seen enough tonight to know where this was heading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling my hood over my head, I slipped away from my hiding spot, blending into the shadows. My mind raced as I made my way back to the rendezvous point where Jenny would be waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived, Jenny was already there, her face illuminated by the soft glow of her phone screen. She looked up as I approached, a knowing look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you get it?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, holding up my phone. &#34;Every second. Dean took Lia, put her in the trunk, and drove off. What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s lips curled into a smirk. &#34;Got Alina acting all high and mighty, giving orders like she owns the world. She&#39;s practically incriminating herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said, though my voice lacked the enthusiasm I usually had for our schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny noticed, her brow furrowing. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, unsure of how to put my feelings into words. &#34;I just I think we&#39;ve been going about this the wrong way. Lia isn&#39;t the real enemy here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny blinked, surprised by my sudden change of heart. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m saying we need to be careful,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;We&#39;ll keep pretending to side with Alina and Dean, but when the time comes, we strike. We&#39;ll expose them for what they&#39;ve done-to Finn, to Lia, to everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny studied me for a moment before nodding. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked away from the smoldering prison, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. Lia might not know it yet, but she had allies in this fight. And I was determined to make things right, no matter what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the secret hideout was damp and cool, the dim light of a single bulb hanging overhead casting flickering shadows on the concrete walls. I tapped my fingers impatiently against the old wooden table, the rhythm steady yet filled with tension. My mind churned over every detail of the plan Dean and I had concocted. This was the final step. Everything had to go perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint rumble broke through the silence, and my lips curled into a smile as Dean&#39;s car headlights pierced through the darkness outside. I stood, smoothing my jacket and bracing myself for his arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the door creaked open, and Dean stepped inside, his movements sharp and confident. He carried the faint scent of smoke and sweat, likely from the chaos he&#39;d orchestrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s done,&#34; he said, his voice low but tinged with satisfaction. &#34;Lia&#39;s in the trunk. Unconscious but alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said, nodding in approval. &#34;You didn&#39;t run into any trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled darkly. &#34;None worth mentioning. The fire created enough distraction to keep the wardens busy, and Bianca was nowhere to be seen. Everything went as planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent.&#34; I gestured to the chair opposite me, and he sat down, leaning back with a smug expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s next?&#34; he asked, folding his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We sneak her into the pack house tonight,&#34; I said, my voice firm. &#34;The cellar is the safest place to keep her. It&#39;s isolated, and no one will think to look there, especially if we spread the right rumors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean raised an eyebrow. &#34;What rumors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked. &#34;We&#39;ll tell the elders that Lia tried to escape. We&#39;ll say she started the fire to create a distraction and that the wardens quickly informed us of her plans. Naturally, being the dutiful pack leaders we are, we intervened and brought her back here before she could fully get away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s grin widened. &#34;And the elders will believe it. They&#39;ve already labeled her guilty in their minds. This will only solidify their resolve to punish her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; I said, satisfaction swelling in my chest. &#34;The timing is perfect. By the time the elders hear of her so-called escape attempt, we&#39;ll already have her secured in the cellar. They&#39;ll trust us to keep her under lock and key until her trial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned forward, his elbows resting on the table. &#34;What about Bianca and Jenny? They&#39;ve been poking around too much lately. Do you think they suspect anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, the thought of those two irritating women souring my mood. &#34;Bianca is loyal to me-or at least, she&#39;s smart enough to pretend she is. As for Jenny, she&#39;s been a thorn in my side for years. But I don&#39;t think they have anything solid on us. Even if they&#39;re suspicious, they won&#39;t be able to act without proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded, though a flicker of doubt crossed his face. &#34;We&#39;ll need to keep an eye on them, just in case. If they become a problem&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll deal with them,&#34; I finished coldly. &#34;Right now, our focus is on Lia. She&#39;s the key to everything. Once she&#39;s out of the way, we&#39;ll finally have control of the pack without anyone standing in our way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean smirked, his confidence returning. &#34;You&#39;ve always been good at this, Alina. Manipulating people, bending them to your will. It&#39;s impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I allowed myself a small smile. &#34;It&#39;s not manipulation, Dean. It&#39;s strategy. The pack needs strong leaders, and I&#39;m the only one who can provide that. Lia was a threat to our stability and to our future. Removing her is a necessity, not a choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean raised his hands in mock surrender. &#34;Whatever you say, Alpha. Just tell me what you need me to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, follow the plan,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Get her to the cellar without anyone noticing. Once she&#39;s secure, we&#39;ll inform the elders of her &#39;escape attempt.&#39; After that, we let the pack&#39;s justice system do the rest. Lia will be convicted, and her punishment will ensure she&#39;s no longer a problem-for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean stood, adjusting his jacket. &#34;Consider it done. Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just don&#39;t get careless,&#34; I warned, my tone sharp. &#34;One misstep and everything we&#39;ve worked for could come crashing down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, a flicker of seriousness crossing his face. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll make sure everything goes smoothly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and headed for the door. I followed him outside, the cool night air brushing against my skin as we stepped into the open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean walked to his car and opened the trunk, glancing back at me with a grin. &#34;Still asleep,&#34; he said, motioning to Lia&#39;s unconscious form inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said, my voice steady despite the surge of triumph I felt. &#34;Let&#39;s move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean closed the trunk and got into his car, the engine rumbling to life. I climbed into my own vehicle, trailing behind him as we made our way back to the pack house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we drove through the dark, deserted roads, my mind raced with thoughts of what was to come. Lia&#39;s fate was sealed, and with her out of the way, nothing would stand between me and the power I deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped the steering wheel tightly, a smile tugging at the corners of my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was only the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>149</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to darkness and the damp, musty smell of earth. My head throbbed painfully, and as I shifted, I realized I was lying on a cold, hard floor. Disoriented, I tried to sit up, but my movements were slow and unsteady. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the faint light seeping through the cracks in the door, revealing the confined space around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cellar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through me as I scrambled to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. I rushed to the heavy wooden door, banging on it with all my strength. &#34;Hello? Is anyone there? Let me out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice echoed in the small space, but there was no response. Frustration bubbled up inside me, and I pounded on the door again, my fists aching with the effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I heard footsteps outside. I froze, holding my breath as the sound grew louder, stopping just on the other side of the door. The lock clicked, and the door creaked open, revealing Dean&#39;s tall, looming figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your voice down,&#34; he said sharply, stepping inside and closing the door behind him. His face was shadowed, but I could see the cold, calculating expression in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why am I here?&#34; I demanded, my voice trembling with a mixture of fear and anger. &#34;Why did you take me from the prison?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean smirked, leaning casually against the wall. &#34;That&#39;s none of your business. Just know that you&#39;ll be brought before the pack elders soon enough. Your judgment is coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms, glaring at him despite the terror clawing at my insides. &#34;Judgment? For what? For a crime I didn&#39;t commit? If anyone deserves to be judged, it&#39;s you, Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow, amusement flickering across his face. &#34;Oh? And what exactly do you think I&#39;ve done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you killed Finn,&#34; I said firmly, my voice steady despite the lump forming in my throat. &#34;I don&#39;t know how you did it, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;re behind it. And trust me, the truth will come out. It always does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean laughed, a low, mocking sound that sent chills down my spine. &#34;You really think anyone will believe you? You&#39;re nothing but a disgrace to the pack now. Nobody cares about your baseless accusations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step forward, my hands clenched into fists. &#34;You can laugh all you want, but your time is running out. People are starting to notice. Bianca, Jenny-do you think they&#39;re just sitting around doing nothing? You won&#39;t get away with this, Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smirk faltered slightly, but he quickly masked it with a sneer. &#34;You&#39;re delusional, Lia. No one is coming to save you. You&#39;re alone in this, just like you&#39;ve always been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, glancing at the screen before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina,&#34; he said, his tone instantly shifting to one of feigned warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced as I heard her name. Alina. She was in on this. Of course, she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina!&#34; I shouted, my voice ringing out in the confined space. &#34;Can you hear me? Do you even know who you&#39;re dealing with? What if Dean is the one who killed Finn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes narrowed, and he stepped closer to me, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper as he spoke into the phone. &#34;I&#39;ll call you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call abruptly and turned his full attention to me, his face twisted with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut your mouth,&#34; he snarled, raising his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I braced myself, but the slap still caught me off guard, the force of it sending me stumbling backward. My cheek burned, and tears stung my eyes, but I refused to let him see me break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know when to stop, do you?&#34; he hissed, his breath hot against my face. &#34;Maybe I should teach you a lesson right here and now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him, my voice steady despite the pain. &#34;Do whatever you want, Dean. You won&#39;t silence me. I&#39;ll keep fighting until the truth comes out, and when it does, you&#39;ll pay for everything you&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, but he didn&#39;t respond. Instead, he stormed out of the cellar, slamming the door behind him. I heard the lock click, and then his footsteps faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone again, I sank to the floor, cradling my aching cheek. Fear and anger churned inside me, warring for dominance. Dean thought he had the upper hand, but I wasn&#39;t going to give up that easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to find a way out of here. For Finn. For myself. And for the truth that needed to be exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat in the darkness, my resolve hardened. Dean and Alina might think they could manipulate everyone around them, but they underestimated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t over not by a long shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet hum of the coffee machine filled the kitchen as I leaned against the counter, waiting for the dark liquid to brew. The aroma filled the air, but it did little to calm the restless thoughts swirling in my mind. My fingers drummed on the countertop, and I sighed, glancing at the clock on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too quiet. Too still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I reached for my mug, my phone buzzed on the counter. The name &#34;Benedicta&#34; flashed on the screen, and a wave of unease settled over me. I grabbed the phone and answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice came through, frantic and rushed. &#34;Luca, you need to get to the prison. It&#39;s on fire!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I froze, the mug slipping from my fingers and shattering on the floor. &#34;What do you mean, the prison is on fire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know all the details, but it&#39;s bad,&#34; she continued, her voice trembling. &#34;The fire broke out in the middle of the night, and I just heard from someone at the station. They&#39;re saying... they&#39;re saying Lia might have been inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stopped. The words hit me like a punch to the gut, and for a moment, I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you now?&#34; I asked, already moving toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at home with Merlin,&#34; she replied. &#34;I wanted to go there, but I can&#39;t leave him alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay there,&#34; I told her firmly. &#34;I&#39;m going to the prison right now. I&#39;ll find out what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca&#34; Her voice softened, laced with worry. &#34;Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up without responding, grabbing my keys and rushing out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the prison felt like an eternity. My mind raced with every possibility, every worst-case scenario. Was she alive? Had she escaped? Or</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. I couldn&#39;t think about that. She had to be alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived, the scene was chaos. Flames still licked at the remains of the building, though firefighters were working tirelessly to put them out. Officers and emergency personnel swarmed the area, their faces grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked the car haphazardly and ran toward the barricades. An officer stopped me, his hand on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, you can&#39;t go any further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to know what&#39;s happening,&#34; I said, my voice desperate. &#34;There&#39;s someone in there-a prisoner. Lia. Is she alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change, and he shook his head. &#34;We&#39;re still gathering information. It&#39;s too early to say anything for certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration bubbled up inside me, and I took a step closer. &#34;Listen, I need answers. If you can&#39;t give them to me, then point me to someone who can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down,&#34; he said sternly, glancing over his shoulder. &#34;I&#39;ll see if someone can speak with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited, pacing back and forth as every second dragged on like an hour. Finally, another officer approached-a woman with a clipboard and an air of authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here about the prisoner Lia?&#34; she asked, her tone brisk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said immediately. &#34;What happened to her? Is she alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at her notes before meeting my gaze. &#34;The fire broke out in the west wing, where she was being held. When we searched her cell, there were no remains-no signs of a body. That leads us to believe she may have been abducted or escaped during the chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Abducted?&#34; My stomach twisted. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;There&#39;s evidence suggesting someone broke into the facility before the fire started. We&#39;re still piecing things together, but right now, our priority is finding her. We&#39;ve issued a search order and alerted nearby authorities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran a hand through my hair, my mind spinning. &#34;Do you have any leads? Anything at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet,&#34; she admitted. &#34;But we&#39;ll find her. If she was taken, whoever did this won&#39;t get far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words did little to comfort me. I turned away, staring at the smoldering remains of the prison. Somewhere out there, Lia was either running for her life or being held against her will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made my chest ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove back to Benedicta&#39;s house in a daze, my hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly that my knuckles turned white. The image of Lia-scared, alone, in danger-played on repeat in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived, Benedicta was waiting for me at the door. Her face was pale, and her hands trembled as she clutched Merlin close to her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;They don&#39;t know. Her cell was empty. They think someone took her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened in horror. &#34;What do you mean, took her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I said, sinking onto the couch and burying my face in my hands. &#34;They&#39;re still investigating, but they&#39;re saying it wasn&#39;t the fire that got her out. Someone planned this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would do that?&#34; she asked, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up, my jaw tightening. &#34;Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, covering her mouth with her hand. &#34;You think he&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think-I know,&#34; I said, my voice hard. &#34;It has his name written all over it. And I swear if he&#39;s hurt her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; Benedicta said softly, placing a hand on my shoulder. &#34;We&#39;ll find her. We&#39;ll bring her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, though my mind was already racing ahead. Dean thought he could play games with Lia&#39;s life, but he underestimated me. I wasn&#39;t going to let him win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>150</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was unusually quiet as I paced back and forth, my mind clouded with regret and unease. Jenny sat on the bed, her hands fiddling with her phone as if she were looking for the courage to speak. Finally, she sighed and broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca, we&#39;ve made some terrible mistakes,&#34; she said softly, her eyes meeting mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped pacing and turned to her, nodding slowly. &#34;I know. What we did to Lia... it wasn&#39;t right. I was so caught up in the moment, in everything Alina and Dean fed us, that I didn&#39;t stop to think for myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny gave me a small, sad smile. &#34;Me too. But it&#39;s not too late. We can still do something to help her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words lit a spark of hope in me. &#34;You&#39;re right. But how? Dean and Alina have her locked up somewhere, and we both know they&#39;ll go to any length to make sure she suffers. If we make a wrong move, they&#39;ll know we&#39;re on to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny bit her lip, thinking hard. Then she grabbed her phone and opened the video she&#39;d recorded of Dean sneaking Lia out of the burning prison. &#34;We have this. It&#39;s proof of what they&#39;ve done. If we can get it to the right person-someone who genuinely wants to help Lia-then maybe we can turn things around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the screen, the grainy footage showing Dean carrying an unconscious Lia to his car and driving off into the night. My chest tightened with guilt. &#34;Who can we trust, though? The elders? No, Dean and Alina have too much influence there. What about Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Yes, Luca! He cares about Lia. If anyone has the drive to bring her back safely, it&#39;s him. And he&#39;s powerful enough to take on Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think he&#39;ll believe us?&#34; I asked, doubt creeping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded firmly. &#34;He&#39;ll believe the video. And once we tell him everything we know about what Alina and Dean have been plotting, he&#39;ll take action. He&#39;s Lia&#39;s best chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, the weight of our decision settling on my shoulders. &#34;Alright. You contact Luca. Set up a meeting with him for tomorrow. We&#39;ll give him the evidence and tell him everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny wasted no time, pulling out her phone and dialing Luca&#39;s number. I watched her as the call connected, my heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Luca?&#34; Jenny said, her voice trembling slightly. &#34;It&#39;s Jenny. I need to talk to you about something important. Can we meet tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hear Luca&#39;s response, but Jenny nodded and said, &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll text you the time and place. Please... don&#39;t tell anyone about this call.&#34; She ended the call and looked at me, relief washing over her face. &#34;It&#39;s done. He&#39;ll meet us tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a breath I didn&#39;t realize I was holding. &#34;Good. Now we just have to make it through the night without anyone finding out what we&#39;re planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stepped out of Jenny&#39;s room, the hallway dimly lit and eerily silent. As we turned the corner, we almost bumped straight into Alina. My heart skipped a beat as her cold, calculating eyes met mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you two sneaking off to?&#34; she asked, her tone casual but laced with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a smile, trying to act as nonchalant as possible. &#34;Just heading out for some air. It&#39;s been a long day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on us as if she were trying to read our minds. Jenny shifted uncomfortably beside me, but I placed a reassuring hand on her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, don&#39;t stay out too long,&#34; Alina said finally, her lips curving into a smirk. &#34;You never know what dangers lurk in the dark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she said it sent a shiver down my spine, but I kept my composure. &#34;We&#39;ll be careful,&#34; I said, and without waiting for her to respond, Jenny and I walked past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we moved further away, I glanced over my shoulder to make sure she wasn&#39;t following us. To my relief, she had turned in the opposite direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think she heard anything?&#34; Jenny whispered, her voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;No. If she had, she wouldn&#39;t have let us go so easily. But we need to be more careful. If she even suspects we&#39;re working against her, we&#39;re as good as dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, her expression grim. &#34;Tomorrow can&#39;t come fast enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of what we were about to do hung heavy between us as we stepped outside. The cool night air did little to calm my nerves, but I clung to the hope that we were finally doing the right thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia didn&#39;t deserve what was happening to her, and while I couldn&#39;t undo the harm I&#39;d already caused, I could do this. I could help set things right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow, we&#39;ll meet Luca. And together, we&#39;d take down Dean and Alina. It was the least I could do to make amends for the part I&#39;d played in Lia&#39;s suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just hoped we weren&#39;t too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight spilled through the narrow corridor as I made my way to Dean&#39;s room. The faint hum of murmured voices from the pack house was a reminder that time was ticking, and the weight of our plans pressed heavily on my shoulders. I reached his door and knocked twice before pushing it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean was sitting on the edge of his bed, flipping through his phone. He looked up as I entered, a sharp smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina,&#34; he said, setting his phone down. &#34;You&#39;re late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored the remark and closed the door behind me. &#34;We have more pressing matters to discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow but gestured for me to take the chair across from him. I sat, crossing my legs, and leaned forward slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The elders,&#34; I began, my voice low. &#34;Their meeting is scheduled for tomorrow. By now, people are definitely wondering where Lia is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned back against the wall, his arms crossed. &#34;Let them wonder. By the time they get their answers, it&#39;ll be too late for anyone to do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. &#34;That kind of overconfidence could cost us, Dean. We need to stay sharp, especially with Bianca and Jenny snooping around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk faded, and his expression darkened. &#34;What makes you think they know something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated for a moment, piecing my thoughts together. &#34;It&#39;s just a feeling. They&#39;ve been acting strange-whispering, avoiding me. Earlier, I nearly bumped into them, and the way they looked at me... it wasn&#39;t normal. It was as if they were hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;If they know anything, they&#39;ll ruin everything we&#39;ve worked for. They can&#39;t be allowed to interfere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m telling you,&#34; I said, my tone firm. &#34;You need to keep an eye on them while I handle the elders tomorrow. We need to ensure our story is airtight, that they believe Lia set the fire in a desperate attempt to escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded, a glint of determination in his eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about Bianca and Jenny. I&#39;ll take care of them. If they&#39;re planning anything, I&#39;ll find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair, feeling slightly reassured but still uneasy. &#34;Good. Because the elders can&#39;t find out the truth. Not yet. If they do, all of this will be for nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean got up and began pacing the room, his movements sharp and deliberate. &#34;Do you really think they&#39;ll believe Lia orchestrated her own escape?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll have no choice,&#34; I said confidently. &#34;We&#39;ll present her as desperate, manipulative, and willing to burn the prison to the ground to avoid punishment. Besides, we&#39;ve always had the elders wrapped around our fingers. They trust us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean stopped pacing and turned to face me. &#34;And what about Bianca and Jenny? If they&#39;ve seen or heard something, they could bring it all crashing down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my lips into a thin line. &#34;That&#39;s why I need you to handle them. Make sure they don&#39;t get the chance to speak out-or better yet, make them doubt themselves. Plant a seed of fear in their minds. If they think we&#39;re onto them, they might back off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded slowly, his expression thoughtful. &#34;I&#39;ll make it happen. But what about Lia? She&#39;s not going to stay quiet forever. The moment she opens her mouth, she&#39;ll try to implicate us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t have the chance,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;By the time the elders are done with her, she&#39;ll be too broken to fight back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s lips curled into a wicked grin. &#34;You&#39;re colder than I thought, Alina. I like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;This isn&#39;t about being cold. It&#39;s about survival. Lia is a threat to everything we&#39;ve built, and threats need to be eliminated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell into a tense silence as we both processed the gravity of our situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you ever think about how we got here?&#34; Dean asked suddenly, his voice softer than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, caught off guard by the question. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How we went from being part of the pack to orchestrating something like this. Do you ever wonder if we&#39;ve gone too far?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffened, unwilling to let doubt creep in. &#34;This is necessary, Dean. Everything we&#39;ve done is for the greater good-for the pack. Lia would have destroyed everything if we didn&#39;t step in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s gaze lingered on me for a moment before he nodded. &#34;You&#39;re right. We can&#39;t let sentimentality cloud our judgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood, brushing imaginary dust off my clothes. &#34;Exactly. Now, focus on Bianca and Jenny. I&#39;ll handle the elders and make sure our story holds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean smirked again, his usual confidence returning. &#34;Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to leave but paused at the door. &#34;And Dean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t underestimate them. Bianca and Jenny might seem like fools, but if they&#39;re desperate enough, they could cause real damage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, his expression serious. &#34;I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, I left the room, my mind already racing with the details of tomorrow&#39;s meeting. Everything had to go perfectly. One misstep and it wouldn&#39;t just be Lia who paid the price-it would be us too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>151</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting on the worn leather couch in Benedicta&#39;s living room, I stared at my phone, replaying Jenny&#39;s words in my head. She had called earlier, her voice trembling as she insisted we meet. She claimed to have information about Lia, information that could turn everything around. My chest tightened at the thought of her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if I can trust her,&#34; I admitted, running a hand through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, her expression filled with concern. &#34;What exactly did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was vague, but she mentioned Lia and said it was urgent. She sounded scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta tilted her head, a thoughtful frown on her face. &#34;Luca, you know this could be a trap. Dean has his claws in everything right now. Jenny could be working for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, my voice sharp with frustration. &#34;But what if she&#39;s telling the truth? What if she really knows where Lia is or what happened to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sat down across from me, her dark eyes steady. &#34;You need to tread carefully. Dean is dangerous, and if he suspects you&#39;re onto him, he won&#39;t hesitate to come after you-or Merlin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Merlin, a wave of protectiveness surged through me. &#34;I won&#39;t let anything happen to him. But I can&#39;t just sit here and do nothing while Lia&#39;s out there, probably suffering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sighed. &#34;I understand, but think about it. Lia&#39;s been missing since that fire, and the only people who know the truth are the ones involved-Dean and Alina. If Jenny really has something to say, you need to verify it before acting on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, knowing she was right. &#34;That&#39;s why I agreed to meet her tomorrow. In public. I&#39;ll make sure she can&#39;t pull anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta tapped her fingers on the table. &#34;Do you think Dean is behind all of this? Finn&#39;s murder, framing Lia, everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward, elbows on my knees, and lowered my voice. &#34;I don&#39;t just think it-I&#39;m sure of it. Dean killed Finn and made it look like Lia did it. He&#39;s manipulative, Benedicta. He&#39;s always been able to twist people and situations to his advantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed. &#34;But why? What does he gain from all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what we need to figure out. Dean doesn&#39;t do anything without a plan. He must be after something-power, control, revenge. Maybe all three.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about Alina? She&#39;s just as involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s blinded by her hatred for Lia. Finn&#39;s death has given her the perfect excuse to destroy Lia&#39;s life, and she&#39;s using it to the fullest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta shook her head. &#34;It&#39;s sick. All of it. But Luca, if we&#39;re going to take them down, we need evidence. Not just hearsay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, clenching my fists. &#34;That&#39;s why I&#39;m meeting Jenny. If she has proof-anything that links Dean or Alina to Finn&#39;s murder-we can use it. But we also need to find out where Lia is. She&#39;s the key to all of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s gaze softened. &#34;You really care about her, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away, my throat tightening. &#34;Lia doesn&#39;t deserve any of this. She&#39;s been through hell, and now she&#39;s being blamed for something she didn&#39;t do. I have to help her. I have to make this right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence hung between us, broken only by the soft ticking of the clock. Then Benedicta reached out and placed a hand on my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful, Luca. Lia needs you, but Merlin needs you too. Don&#39;t let your anger cloud your judgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, taking her words to heart. &#34;I won&#39;t. But I won&#39;t let Dean and Alina get away with this either. If Jenny has what I think she does, we&#39;re one step closer to exposing them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta gave a small smile, though her worry was still evident. &#34;Just promise me you&#39;ll come back in one piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise,&#34; I said, though the weight of the situation made my chest feel heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stood to leave, Benedicta called out, &#34;Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back, and she hesitated before speaking. &#34;Do you think Lia knows? About Dean&#39;s involvement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about it for a moment, picturing Lia&#39;s fiery determination even in the face of adversity. &#34;If she doesn&#39;t know yet, she&#39;ll figure it out. Lia&#39;s stronger than we give her credit for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta nodded, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked out into the cool night air, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that time was running out. Dean and Alina were dangerous, yes, but the real danger lay in underestimating them. Lia&#39;s life-and the truth-depended on what happened next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill of the early morning air bit into my skin as I stood in the parking lot, leaning casually against the hood of my car. The sun had barely risen, but I was already on edge. I knew Bianca and Jenny would show up sooner or later, and I intended to make sure I knew where they were going. Alina had her suspicions about them, and I wasn&#39;t about to let my guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of footsteps echoed across the lot, and I straightened up. Sure enough, Bianca and Jenny appeared, chatting quietly until they spotted me. Their expressions faltered for a split second before they quickly masked their surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; Jenny greeted flatly, her hand tightening around her bag strap. &#34;What are you doing here so early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms, giving them both a hard look. &#34;Just following orders. Alina wants me to keep track of everyone&#39;s whereabouts. You know, with everything going on-Finn&#39;s murder, Lia&#39;s disappearance-it&#39;s important to stay vigilant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca snorted, clearly unimpressed. &#34;That&#39;s rich coming from you. Why don&#39;t you station yourself somewhere useful instead of bothering us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her jab, I stepped forward. &#34;Where are you headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny raised an eyebrow, her tone turning defensive. &#34;What&#39;s it to you? We&#39;re going to the mall. That&#39;s it. Now get out of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t budge. &#34;You&#39;ll forgive me for not taking your word for it. Finn was killed, the killer is still out there, and now Lia&#39;s missing. Everyone&#39;s a suspect. Including you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca let out a dry laugh, shaking her head. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s funny. You think we&#39;re suspects?&#34; She took a step closer, her eyes narrowing. &#34;You&#39;re more of a suspect than we&#39;ll ever be. Let&#39;s not forget who you are, Dean. You&#39;re Lia&#39;s ex, an outsider in this clan, and someone with more secrets than anyone else here. Maybe it&#39;s you we should be keeping an eye on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit harder than I cared to admit, and for a moment, I couldn&#39;t hide my shock. How did they know all that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful, Bianca,&#34; I said, my voice low. &#34;Throwing around accusations like that can be dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny smirked, clearly enjoying the exchange. &#34;Is that a threat, Dean? Because if it is, let me remind you-you&#39;re not in charge here. You answer to Alina, just like everyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw, my frustration mounting. They were toying with me, and it was working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca pushed past me, yanking open the car door. &#34;We don&#39;t have time for your paranoia. If you want to waste your day playing detective, be my guest. But leave us out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny followed suit, pausing only to flash me a mocking smile. &#34;Have fun spinning your conspiracy theories, Dean. Maybe you&#39;ll stumble onto something useful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, they slammed the car doors shut, started the engine, and drove off, leaving me standing in the lot, fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched their car disappear around the corner, my mind racing. They knew too much-about me, about Alina&#39;s plans, about everything. And yet, they were acting like they had nothing to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something wasn&#39;t adding up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my phone, dialing Alina&#39;s number as I walked back to my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered on the second ring. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem,&#34; I said, sliding into the driver&#39;s seat. &#34;Bianca and Jenny are onto something. They know more than they&#39;re letting on, and they&#39;re not afraid to challenge me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s voice was cold and calculating. &#34;What did they say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They brought up Finn&#39;s murder and Lia&#39;s disappearance,&#34; I explained. &#34;They even implied I&#39;m the one who should be under suspicion. They&#39;re trying to rattle me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them,&#34; Alina said, her tone dismissive. &#34;They don&#39;t have anything concrete. Just keep an eye on them and report back if they slip up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I muttered, though her confidence did little to ease my irritation. &#34;But if they&#39;re digging into my past, they could become a real problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then make sure they don&#39;t find anything,&#34; Alina snapped. &#34;We can&#39;t afford any loose ends, Dean. Not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words lingered in my mind long after the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat there, staring out at the empty parking lot, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the walls were closing in. Lia&#39;s disappearance, Finn&#39;s murder, Bianca and Jenny&#39;s sudden defiance-it was all spiraling out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if they thought they could outsmart me, they were sorely mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>152</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and I exchanged a knowing glance as we drove down the main road, the morning sun casting long shadows over the car&#39;s dashboard. Dean&#39;s little stunt in the parking lot was laughable. The way he tried to play the enforcer, pretending to be the innocent one, was almost amusing if it weren&#39;t so infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you believe him?&#34; Bianca scoffed, leaning back in her seat with crossed arms. &#34;Acting like we&#39;re suspects when we already know what he&#39;s capable of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, gripping the steering wheel tighter. &#34;He&#39;s so transparent, it&#39;s pathetic. But let him think he&#39;s in control. The more he underestimates us, the easier it&#39;ll be to take him down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nodded, her expression hardening. &#34;He thinks we&#39;re clueless, but we&#39;ve got him pegged. And Alina, too. They won&#39;t see us coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could reply, my phone buzzed on the console. Luca&#39;s name flashed on the screen, and I quickly answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Luca&#39;s voice was tense and low like he was barely holding himself together. &#34;I&#39;m waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, keeping my tone calm. &#34;But we&#39;ve got a problem. Dean&#39;s probably following us. I need to throw him off our trail first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end before Luca spoke again, his voice heavy with concern. &#34;Be careful, Jenny. If he realizes you&#39;re onto him, he won&#39;t hesitate to retaliate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I replied firmly. &#34;Just hold tight. I&#39;ll get to you as soon as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up and turned to Bianca, who was already grinning. &#34;So, what&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced in the rearview mirror, spotting the black sedan trailing a few cars behind us. &#34;We&#39;re going to the mall. If Dean wants to play spy, let&#39;s give him something to watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca chuckled. &#34;I love this. It&#39;s like a game of cat and mouse, and he doesn&#39;t even know he&#39;s losing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We pulled into the mall parking lot, making a point to park in a spot that was visible from the road. As we stepped out of the car, I caught a glimpse of the black sedan slowing down before it turned into the lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s here,&#34; I whispered to Bianca, nodding discreetly toward the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even glance back, her confidence unshaken. &#34;Good. Let&#39;s give him a show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We strolled into the mall, our pace leisurely, as if we had nothing better to do than shop. The air was filled with the chatter of shoppers and the faint scent of coffee wafting from a nearby café.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll go into a few stores and pick up some things,&#34; I said quietly as we walked. &#34;Make it look convincing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nodded, already scanning the storefronts. &#34;I could use a new pair of shoes anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ducked into a boutique, pretending to browse while keeping an eye on the glass doors. Sure enough, Dean&#39;s figure appeared moments later, lurking near the entrance like a wolf on the prowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca smirked, picking up a pair of heels and holding them up. &#34;What do you think? Too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh softly. &#34;Perfect for distracting a would-be spy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continued shopping, moving from one store to the next, all the while aware of Dean&#39;s presence. He wasn&#39;t exactly subtle, but that worked to our advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we stepped into a larger department store, Bianca leaned close and whispered, &#34;He&#39;s still following us. Do you think he&#39;ll get bored?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a chance,&#34; I replied. &#34;Dean&#39;s too paranoid to let us out of his sight. But that&#39;s fine. The longer he&#39;s stuck here, the less time he has to cause trouble elsewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca grabbed a scarf off a rack and held it up to her neck, posing dramatically. &#34;Do you think this screams &#39;innocent suspect&#39; or &#39;mastermind in disguise&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, stifling a laugh. &#34;You&#39;re impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hours ticked by, we made our way through the mall, loading up on bags to sell the illusion. Dean&#39;s shadow remained constant, a reminder of the dangerous game we were playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite the stakes, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a surge of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, we were in control. And if Dean thought he could outsmart us, he was in for a rude awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nudged me as we headed toward the food court. &#34;Think we&#39;ve distracted him enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost,&#34; I said, glancing over my shoulder. Dean was leaning against a pillar, his eyes fixed on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s grab something to eat,&#34; I added. &#34;Make him wait a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca grinned. &#34;You&#39;re really enjoying this, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, unable to hide my smirk. &#34;Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s nice to be the one pulling the strings for a change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we sat down with our food, I sent a quick text to Luca, letting him know the coast was clear-for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean might think he was the predator, but he was about to learn what it felt like to be the prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped my phone tightly as I made my way down the dimly lit path toward the cellar. The air was damp, and the faint scent of mildew clung to the walls. Dean&#39;s voice crackled on the other end of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any updates?&#34; I asked sharply, my patience wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She and that little friend of hers went to the mall,&#34; Dean replied. &#34;I&#39;ve been tailing them for hours. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re up to something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, rubbing my temple. &#34;Don&#39;t let them out of your sight. Whatever they&#39;re planning, I need to know before it blows up in our faces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, Alina,&#34; Dean said, his tone oozing with confidence. &#34;I&#39;ve got it under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me regret trusting you,&#34; I snapped before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Bianca and Jenny running loose, scheming behind my back, made my blood boil. They were loose threads, and I hated loose threads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy door to the cellar loomed ahead. I pushed it open, the creak of its hinges echoing in the empty corridor. Stepping inside, I spotted Lia slumped against the wall, her head resting on her knees. She looked so peaceful, almost fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed at the sight, my heels clicking loudly on the stone floor as I approached her. Without hesitation, I raised my foot and pressed it down on her leg. Hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia jolted awake with a gasp, her face contorting in pain. &#34;What the-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rise and shine,&#34; I said mockingly, taking a step back as she glared up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want now, Alina?&#34; she spat, her voice laced with defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms, a smirk tugging at my lips. &#34;Oh, I just thought you&#39;d like to know something interesting. Something about a certain little boy named Merlin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, and for a brief moment, I saw a flicker of fear cross her face. She quickly masked it, but I had already seen enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about him?&#34; she demanded, her tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched down, meeting her gaze with cold amusement. &#34;You see, I&#39;ve been keeping tabs on him. He&#39;s safe... for now. With that lovely woman, Benedicta. But the thing is, I&#39;ve got eyes everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stay away from my son,&#34; Lia hissed, her voice trembling with barely restrained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled, standing up and brushing imaginary dust off my pants. &#34;Or what? You&#39;ll stop me? Hate to break it to you, darling, but you&#39;re in no position to make threats.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands balled into fists, and she gritted her teeth. &#34;If you touch him, I swear you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regret it?&#34; I echoed, tilting my head. &#34;You&#39;re awfully bold for someone locked in a cellar, awaiting judgment. But don&#39;t worry, Lia. I don&#39;t need to hurt him-unless, of course, you give me a reason to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing quickened, and I could see the panic setting in. Good. That&#39;s exactly what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now,&#34; I continued, straightening my posture, &#34;you&#39;d better get yourself together. In three hours, you&#39;ll be standing before the pack elders. And trust me, they&#39;re not exactly known for their leniency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s defiant gaze met mine, but I could see the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you&#39;ll win, Alina?&#34; she said, her voice low and steady. &#34;You think you&#39;ll get away with everything you&#39;ve done? The truth has a funny way of coming out. And when it does, you&#39;ll wish you never crossed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, the sound echoing in the confined space. &#34;Oh, Lia. You&#39;re adorable when you&#39;re delusional. Enjoy your last few hours of false hope. You&#39;re going to need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I turned on my heel and walked toward the door. Before stepping out, I glanced back over my shoulder, giving her one last smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweet dreams, Lia,&#34; I said, my tone dripping with mockery. &#34;You&#39;re going to need all the rest you can get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut the door behind me, the heavy sound of the lock clicking into place echoing through the corridor. As I walked back toward the main house, my phone buzzed in my pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re leaving the mall. Headed back. Nothing suspicious so far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, typing back a quick response. &#34;Keep tailing them. I&#39;ll handle the elders. Just make sure those two don&#39;t screw this up for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I slipped my phone back into my pocket, a small smile played on my lips. Everything was falling into place. Lia could fight and scream all she wanted, but the game was already won. All I needed to do now was play my part and let the pieces fall where they may.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>153</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the past few days bore down on me like a suffocating blanket. I couldn&#39;t shake the gnawing worry about Lia. She was out there somewhere alive, I hoped but every passing second without answers felt like a dagger twisting in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed, pulling me from my thoughts. Jenny&#39;s voice came through the line, calm but urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my jacket and stepped out of my car, spotting Jenny and Bianca standing near the café&#39;s entrance. They looked anxious, their gazes darting around as if someone might overhear them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s make this quick,&#34; I said, gesturing for them to follow me to a quieter corner of the park nearby. &#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny glanced at Bianca before speaking. &#34;It&#39;s about Lia... and Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of his name made my fists clench. &#34;What about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca took a deep breath, her expression conflicted. &#34;We know where Lia is being kept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. &#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the pack house,&#34; she said, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;In the cellar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, trying to process the information. The pack house? That was Alina&#39;s territory, and it didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out she was involved in this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know this?&#34; I asked, narrowing my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny pulled out her phone, scrolling through her gallery before handing it to me. &#34;We&#39;ve been following Dean and Alina for days, watching their every move. This is what we&#39;ve found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen displayed a video of Dean sneaking Lia unconscious out of the burning prison and loading her into a car. Another video showed Alina entering the cellar, her expression smug and satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that&#39;s not all,&#34; Jenny continued. &#34;We also know that Dean killed Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit me like a punch to the gut. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nodded. &#34;He&#39;s been framing Lia this whole time, making her look guilty to cover his tracks. Alina&#39;s helping him, probably because she has her own agenda. We don&#39;t know all the details yet, but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re working together to destroy her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged through me, my hands curling into fists. &#34;Finn was one of my closest friends. And now Lia is suffering because of their lies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny put a hand on my arm, her expression serious. &#34;That&#39;s why we&#39;re here, Luca. We need to work together to stop them. We can&#39;t let them win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm raging inside me. &#34;What&#39;s the plan? How do we vindicate Lia and expose them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca spoke up, her voice firm. &#34;First, we need more evidence. The videos we have are good, but they&#39;re not enough to convince the elders. We need something concrete, something that links Dean directly to Finn&#39;s murder and Alina to the conspiracy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Lia?&#34; I asked. &#34;We can&#39;t leave her in that cellar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded. &#34;We&#39;ll get her out, but we have to be careful. If we move too soon, Dean and Alina will cover their tracks, and we&#39;ll lose our chance to expose them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran a hand through my hair, frustration boiling under my skin. &#34;So, what&#39;s the next step?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny exchanged a glance with Bianca. &#34;We&#39;ll keep tailing them, gathering as much evidence as we can. You need to find a way to discreetly question the pack elders. See if any of them are already suspicious of Dean or Alina. If we can plant the idea that something&#39;s off, it&#39;ll be easier to present our case when the time comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about Lia?&#34; I pressed. &#34;We can&#39;t leave her there indefinitely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca hesitated before speaking. &#34;We&#39;ll keep an eye on her, make sure she&#39;s safe until we&#39;re ready to act. The last thing we want is for Alina or Dean to panic and do something reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan felt fragile, like it could crumble at any moment. But it was all we had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; I said finally. &#34;I&#39;ll do my part. But if anything happens to Lia-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t let anything happen to her,&#34; Jenny interrupted, her tone resolute. &#34;We&#39;re in this together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, though the unease in my chest remained. &#34;Let&#39;s get to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we left the park, my mind raced with possibilities. Dean and Alina thought they had won, that they had silenced Lia and buried the truth. But they were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because now, they had me to deal with. And I wasn&#39;t going to stop until Lia was free and justice was served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The roads blurred as I drove aimlessly, frustration boiling in my veins. How the hell had I lost them? Bianca and Jenny had been in my sight for hours, and then, like ghosts, they vanished into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed my fist against the steering wheel, the car skidding slightly before I corrected it. Something wasn&#39;t right about those two. The way they brushed me off earlier, their sudden outings-it all reeked of suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling into the driveway of the pack house, I parked haphazardly and stormed inside. The house felt suffocating, its familiar walls closing in around me. I didn&#39;t bother knocking on Alina&#39;s door before barging in. She was standing by her vanity, fixing her hair, her reflection calm and collected in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, Dean?&#34; she asked, not even glancing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I lost them,&#34; I growled, pacing the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca and Jenny,&#34; I snapped. &#34;They&#39;ve been acting strange, sneaking around, and now they&#39;re gone. I think they&#39;re up to something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught her attention. She turned to face me, her brow furrowed. &#34;What do you mean, &#39;up to something&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I admitted, running a hand through my hair. &#34;But they&#39;re not being subtle. They know something, Alina, and I don&#39;t like it. They&#39;ve been watching me, asking too many questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina crossed her arms, her gaze narrowing. &#34;Do you think they know about Lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated. &#34;Maybe. Or worse, they could have evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence filled the room, broken only by the ticking of the clock on the wall. Then Alina sighed, her calm demeanor replaced with a flicker of irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t afford any loose ends,&#34; she said. &#34;Keep a close eye on them, Dean. And when they return, don&#39;t let them out of your sight until they tell you everything they know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if they don&#39;t talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked smile curled on her lips. &#34;Then make them talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, the weight of her words settling on me. I&#39;d do whatever it took to protect what we&#39;d built.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; I asked as she picked up her coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a meeting with the elders in a few minutes,&#34; she replied. &#34;They&#39;re starting to ask questions about Lia&#39;s disappearance, and I need to get ahead of it. Which reminds me-Lia needs to be ready for the meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you planning to do with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina smirked, a cold glint in her eyes. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure she stays quiet. The elders just need to see her as the desperate prisoner she is. Nothing more, nothing less. After that, we can deal with her however we please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confidence was infectious, but I couldn&#39;t shake the gnawing feeling in my gut. Bianca and Jenny were wild cards, and if they exposed us, everything would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if the elders start digging deeper?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t,&#34; she said firmly. &#34;Not if we play this right. Now, go do your job, Dean. Handle Bianca and Jenny. Leave Lia and the elders to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded again, though the unease lingered. As Alina left the room, I stood there for a moment, staring at the closed door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This plan had been perfect. Every piece meticulously placed, every angle considered. But now? The cracks were starting to show, and I wasn&#39;t sure if we could patch them up in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I left Alina&#39;s room and made my way downstairs. The packed house was eerily quiet, the tension in the air thick enough to cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and Jenny were out there, probably plotting something, and Lia was locked away in the cellar, waiting for whatever twisted fate Alina had planned for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my fists. I needed to get ahead of this. Bianca and Jenny wouldn&#39;t know what hit them, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia? She&#39;d face the elders soon enough, and after that, she wouldn&#39;t be a problem anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, though, I had work to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>154</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold stone floor beneath me was a cruel reminder of my reality, my back pressed against the damp wall of the cellar. My body ached with exhaustion and pain, each bruise a testament to the torment I had endured at the hands of Dean and Alina. The cell was stifling, suffocating in its silence, and I could feel my breath becoming shallow as panic bubbled just beneath the surface. I wasn&#39;t sure how long I&#39;d been here, but the isolation and darkness were wearing me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint creak of the cellar door jolted me to attention. Footsteps echoed down the stairs, slow and deliberate. I already knew who it was, even before she stepped into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her presence filled the room as she approached, her polished, composed demeanor standing in stark contrast to the grim surroundings. She held something in her hand something that glinted in the dim light. A dress. A ridiculous gesture of control. She tossed it onto the floor in front of me like I was nothing more than an object she could manipulate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up,&#34; she ordered sharply, &#34;and put this on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t move at first. My muscles were stiff from sitting too long, and the idea of playing along with whatever twisted game she was setting up felt nauseating. &#34;Why?&#34; I croaked, my throat dry from the lack of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s lips curled into a cold smile, her eyes narrowed with disdain. &#34;You&#39;re meeting the elders, Lia. You&#39;re not going to that meeting looking like a prisoner. You&#39;ll put this on, and you&#39;ll do exactly as I say, or I&#39;ll drag you out of here in chains.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sickening surge of dread gripped my chest, but I fought it down. She was trying to break me. Trying to make me fear the inevitable. But I wouldn&#39;t give her that satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly stood up, my legs trembling as I reached for the dress. It was an elegant piece, but the fabric felt like a mockery against the cold stone of the cellar. The irony wasn&#39;t lost on me Alina had no respect for anything except power, and this was just another way for her to exert control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the plan, Alina?&#34; I asked, my voice coming out raspier than I intended. I had to know. I had to understand what game she was playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s eyes flashed with impatience as she stared at me, her arms crossing over her chest. &#34;I&#39;ve already told the elders everything,&#34; she said, her voice dripping with venom. &#34;That you escaped from prison on your own, that you started the fire, and that you killed Finn.&#34; Her words were meant to sting, and they did. &#34;Now you&#39;re going to play your part. You&#39;re going to confess to everything I&#39;ve accused you of, and then we&#39;ll see what happens to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of anger rise within me, hotter than anything I had felt before. &#34;You&#39;re lying,&#34; I spat, the words laced with venom. &#34;I didn&#39;t kill Finn. And I didn&#39;t start that fire. You&#39;re the one behind all of this. You and Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s lips twisted into a cruel smile, but there was a flash of something dark in her eyes. She took a step toward me, her gaze locking onto mine with an intensity that sent a chill down my spine. &#34;You&#39;re not in a position to make demands, Lia,&#34; she hissed, her voice low and dangerous. &#34;If you don&#39;t keep quiet, I&#39;ll finish you off. No one will care, and no one will ever know. And you know what? I&#39;ll make sure your precious son suffers for your disobedience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit me like a punch to the gut. Merlin. She was threatening my son now. My heart raced, a cold sweat breaking out across my forehead. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare touch him,&#34; I whispered through gritted teeth. &#34;If you do, you&#39;ll regret it. I swear to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s smile only widened, as if she found my defiance amusing. She grabbed my arm roughly, dragging me toward the stairs, my feet stumbling as I was pulled upward. &#34;You&#39;re not in control here, Lia. And you never will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest tightened as we ascended the stairs, and I tried to steady my breath, to focus. This wasn&#39;t the end. It couldn&#39;t be. I couldn&#39;t let her win. I wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the top of the stairs, Alina pulled open the door to the hallway. The bright light from the elders&#39; chamber filtered in, and I could hear the murmur of voices. My heart pounded in my chest, my body instinctively tensing as we approached the large double doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is it,&#34; Alina said, her voice tinged with satisfaction. &#34;You&#39;ll confess. You&#39;ll tell them everything I&#39;ve said, and you&#39;ll accept whatever punishment they decide. Or I&#39;ll make sure you never see the light of day again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced my feet to move, my body betraying me as I was pulled forward, the door swinging open before us. The elders were already gathered inside, their faces grim and expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood tall, despite the fear gnawing at me from within. &#34;You can do whatever you want to me, Alina,&#34; I said, my voice unwavering. &#34;But I will never admit to something I didn&#39;t do. I won&#39;t be your puppet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved me forward into the room, and as the heavy doors slammed shut behind us, I realized that this was only the beginning. I would find a way to expose her, to protect Merlin and the truth. And no matter what Alina thought, this game wasn&#39;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors to the large hall swung open with a heavy, resounding thud as I pushed Lia forward. She stumbled slightly, still weak from her time in the cellar, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to care. This was her punishment, and it was long overdue. She had become a thorn in my side, a complication I hadn&#39;t expected, but now I was in control. She had no choice but to bend to my will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Lia stood, head held high, despite the obvious strain in her posture. She had spirit, that was for sure, but spirit didn&#39;t win in this game. Power did. And I had it all. I could already see the looks on the elders&#39; faces-some of them sympathetic, some of them indifferent, but all of them eager to see what would happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked to my seat at the head of the table, my eyes never leaving Lia. &#34;Take your seat,&#34; I ordered, my voice laced with authority. She hesitated for a brief moment, but eventually, she complied, sitting down at the center of the room, her eyes scanning the faces around her. It didn&#39;t matter. None of them would help her. They were all too afraid of me to challenge anything I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting commenced with a few formalities, but I was already lost in my thoughts, anticipating Lia&#39;s response to the charges against her. She would confess. She had no other choice. I had prepared the narrative perfectly: that Lia had escaped from prison, that she had caused the fire, and that she was responsible for Finn&#39;s death. The elders would have no reason not to believe me. But Lia, of course, had other plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the floor was opened for her defense, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a slight stir of irritation as she stood and denied everything. Her voice was steady, but there was no mistaking the defiance in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill Finn,&#34; Lia said, her voice firm and unwavering. &#34;I didn&#39;t start that fire. You&#39;re the one who&#39;s behind all of this. You, Alina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her accusation was nothing short of audacious. The room fell into an uncomfortable silence, and for a moment, I felt the sting of her words. But I couldn&#39;t let her get away with this. Not now, not after everything I&#39;d done to ensure her guilt would be seen by everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; I said calmly, masking my anger with a veneer of patience. &#34;You&#39;re only digging yourself a deeper hole. This defiance won&#39;t save you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t listen. She stared at me defiantly, and that only fueled my rage. Her refusal to acknowledge the truth was insufferable, and in that moment, I made a decision. I signaled to the elders to adjourn the meeting, to give Lia a brief respite before we continued. But I knew what would happen next-there was no way in hell she would escape the punishment she deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room cleared, and I walked out of the hall, a cold determination building within me. I had to deal with Lia. And I would do it in a way that made her understand exactly who was in charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way to the dungeons, my footsteps echoing off the stone walls as I descended into the depths of the pack house. The air was thick with a damp, oppressive scent, and the dim lighting cast shadows across the walls, making the space feel even more claustrophobic. I entered the cell where Lia was being held, my eyes narrowing as I took in her form. She was slumped against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest, her face set in that same stubborn defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; I said, my voice low, as I walked toward her. &#34;You&#39;re being very foolish. Your denial is only making things worse for you. You have no idea what I&#39;m capable of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her head slowly, her eyes meeting mine with an intensity that sent a shiver down my spine. &#34;You think I&#39;m afraid of you?&#34; she asked, her voice steady but tinged with exhaustion. &#34;You think I&#39;m going to bend to your threats? You&#39;re wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, leaning in closer, my face just inches from hers. &#34;I don&#39;t need you to be afraid of me. I just need you to understand that you have no choice. You will confess in the next meeting. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll make sure that the consequences are worse than anything you&#39;ve ever imagined. I&#39;ll take everything from you-your son, your freedom, your life. And there won&#39;t be anyone left to save you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face remained stoic, but I could see the flicker of fear in her eyes. She wasn&#39;t as strong as she pretended to be. And I was going to make her break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll never confess to something I didn&#39;t do,&#34; Lia muttered, the words coming out barely above a whisper. &#34;You can threaten me all you want, but I&#39;ll never be your pawn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, the sound echoing in the cold, empty space. &#34;You&#39;ll see, Lia. You&#39;ll confess, or I&#39;ll make sure you wish you had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned on my heel, walking toward the door, but I paused before I left, turning back to face her one last time. &#34;You&#39;ve made your choice, Lia. And now you&#39;ll suffer the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I left the dungeon, the heavy door slamming shut behind me. I didn&#39;t need to hear any more of her useless defiance. The next time we met with the elders, she would h</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ave no choice but to admit to the crimes she had committed-or face a far worse fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>155</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and I stepped out of the car, exhausted but feeling a small sense of accomplishment after managing to give Dean the slip earlier. It had been a long day, and all I wanted was to get inside, grab something to eat, and collapse on my bed. But as soon as we walked toward the front door, I saw him. Dean. Leaning casually against the porch railing, his arms crossed over his chest and a smirk playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; Jenny muttered under her breath, her expression immediately hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at her, then back at Dean. &#34;Trouble,&#34; I replied quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies,&#34; Dean greeted us, his tone laced with mock politeness. &#34;Long day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes and walked past him toward the door, but he stepped in front of me, blocking my way. &#34;Not so fast,&#34; he said. &#34;Where have you two been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out,&#34; Jenny replied nonchalantly, folding her arms across her chest. &#34;What&#39;s it to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk deepened as his eyes narrowed. &#34;Out where? Because last I checked, Alina gave me strict instructions to monitor everyone&#39;s movements. So, I suggest you tell me the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the audacity of this man. &#34;You&#39;re really out here playing watchdog for Alina? That&#39;s pathetic, even for you, Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, but he didn&#39;t respond to the insult. Instead, he turned his attention to Jenny. &#34;I&#39;m serious. Where were you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny rolled her eyes dramatically. &#34;We went to the mall, Dean. Do you want a detailed list of the things we bought, too? Maybe the receipt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean wasn&#39;t buying it, and his piercing gaze lingered on us as though he could see through the flimsy excuse. &#34;The mall, huh?&#34; he said slowly, his tone dripping with skepticism. &#34;And you expect me to believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe whatever you want,&#34; I said, stepping closer to him, my voice firm. &#34;But if you&#39;re trying to accuse us of something, you better have proof. Otherwise, get out of our way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk faltered for a moment, and I could see the frustration brewing behind his eyes. &#34;You think you&#39;re clever, don&#39;t you?&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny scoffed. &#34;We don&#39;t have to think it. We know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, I pushed past him and opened the door, motioning for Jenny to follow me. She didn&#39;t hesitate, and together we walked into the house, leaving Dean standing on the porch, seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we were inside, I locked the door behind us and let out a heavy sigh. &#34;He&#39;s definitely suspicious,&#34; I said, leaning against the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, tossing her bag onto the couch. &#34;Yeah, but let him be. He doesn&#39;t have anything on us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now,&#34; I added, my voice low. &#34;We have to be careful, Jenny. He&#39;s not going to let this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny sat down, crossing her legs and drumming her fingers on the armrest. &#34;Let him try. If he pushes too hard, we&#39;ll deal with him. He&#39;s all bark and no bite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t so sure. Dean was dangerous, and we both knew it. But we didn&#39;t have time to dwell on that now. There was too much at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the plan?&#34; I asked, lowering my voice. &#34;Do you think Luca believed you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded. &#34;He did. He&#39;s on board. But we need to act fast. The longer we wait, the more time Dean and Alina have to cover their tracks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chewed on my bottom lip, my mind racing. &#34;We need to figure out our next move. We can&#39;t just sit here and wait for something to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny leaned forward, her expression serious. &#34;I agree. But first, we need to be absolutely sure we can trust Luca. If he slips up, this whole thing could fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;You&#39;re right. Let&#39;s keep the details vague for now. Just enough to keep him on our side without giving away too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; Jenny said, a small smile playing on her lips. &#34;We&#39;ve got this, Bianca. We just need to stay one step ahead of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as I wanted to believe her, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of unease that settled in my chest. Dean wasn&#39;t going to give up easily, and neither was Alina. We were playing a dangerous game, and the stakes were higher than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should get some rest,&#34; I said finally, glancing at the clock. &#34;Tomorrow&#39;s going to be a long day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, standing up and stretching. &#34;Yeah. Let&#39;s get some sleep. We&#39;ll figure out our next move in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her head toward her room, my mind still racing with thoughts and possibilities. Dean might have been left standing outside tonight, but I knew he wasn&#39;t done with us. And neither was Alina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in the middle of a storm, and the only way out was to fight. But no matter what, I wasn&#39;t going to let them win. Not this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my heels echoed in the hallway as I made my way to Dean&#39;s room. The meeting with the elders had been frustrating, to say the least. Lia had denied every accusation, and despite my carefully constructed lies, they were hesitant to deliver a final verdict. They wanted more evidence. Evidence I didn&#39;t have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached Dean&#39;s door and knocked once before pushing it open. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the floor. He looked up when I entered, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk,&#34; I said, closing the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About the meeting?&#34; he asked, his tone neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, walking over to the chair across from him and sitting down. &#34;It didn&#39;t go as planned. Lia denied everything, of course, and the elders decided to adjourn the session. They want more time to &#39;investigate.&#39;&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;As if they&#39;ll find anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned back, his arms crossed over his chest. &#34;So, what now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now,&#34; I said, leaning forward, &#34;we have to make sure Lia doesn&#39;t have the chance to twist the narrative. She needs to confess, Dean. If she doesn&#39;t, the elders might start asking the wrong questions. Questions that could lead back to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded but didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Bianca and Jenny?&#34; I asked, narrowing my eyes. &#34;Did you find out anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean sighed, shaking his head. &#34;No. I followed them for most of the day, but they managed to lose me. I don&#39;t know where they went or what they were doing, but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. &#34;They&#39;re up to no good. I can feel it. We need to keep a closer eye on them, Dean. If they&#39;re working against us, we can&#39;t let them get away with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle it,&#34; he said, his voice firm. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll get to the bottom of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied him for a moment, searching for any signs of doubt or hesitation. Dean was usually so composed, so confident, but tonight he seemed... off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said, deciding to let it go for now. &#34;Because we don&#39;t have time for mistakes. The elders are already skeptical, and the last thing we need is for Bianca and Jenny to start stirring up trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded but remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something else,&#34; I said after a moment. &#34;When I went to the cellar to get Lia for the meeting, she said something that caught my attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean looked at me, his expression carefully neutral. &#34;What did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said that the real murderer might still be out there,&#34; I replied, watching him closely. &#34;That whoever killed Finn could be waiting to strike again. She even suggested that I could be next if I&#39;m not careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the briefest moment, I thought I saw a flicker of something in Dean&#39;s eyes-fear, maybe, or guilt-but it was gone as quickly as it appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she?&#34; he said, his tone casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said, leaning forward. &#34;And I noticed you looked... shocked just now. Is there something you&#39;re not telling me, Dean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head quickly, almost too quickly. &#34;No. There&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m just surprised Lia would say something like that. She&#39;s clearly trying to mess with your head, Alina. Don&#39;t let her get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes, studying him carefully. Dean was a good liar, but I had spent enough time around him to know when something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She also said that the truth will come out eventually,&#34; I added, watching his reaction closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s jaw tightened, but he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; I said, my voice low. &#34;If there&#39;s something I need to know, now is the time to tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing,&#34; he said firmly, standing up and walking over to the window. &#34;Lia&#39;s just trying to save herself. She&#39;ll say anything to get under your skin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t believe him, but I decided not to press the issue. Not yet, anyway. There were more important things to deal with right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said, standing up and smoothing down my dress. &#34;But we need to act fast. Lia has to confess at the next meeting, no matter what it takes. If she doesn&#39;t, everything we&#39;ve worked for could fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean turned to face me, his expression unreadable. &#34;She&#39;ll confess,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She better,&#34; I said, walking toward the door. &#34;Because if she doesn&#39;t, she won&#39;t be the only one facing consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I left the room, my mind racing. Something wasn&#39;t right with Dean, and I was going</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to find out what it was. But first, I had to deal with Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she thought she could outsmart me, she was in for a rude awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>156</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned against the cold windowpane of my room, Alina&#39;s words echoing in my mind. &#34;The truth will come out eventually.&#34; She had said it so casually, but the way her eyes pierced mine told me she suspected something. Alina wasn&#39;t stupid if anything, she was the most cunning person I&#39;d ever met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t let her unravel this. Not now, not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pacing the room, I pulled out my phone and dialed one of my guards. &#34;I need eyes on Bianca and Jenny,&#34; I ordered, my voice cold and sharp. &#34;From now on, I want them followed whenever they leave the house. I want to know where they go, who they meet, and what they&#39;re planning. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; the voice on the other end replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call and tossed the phone onto the bed, rubbing a hand over my face. Bianca and Jenny were up to something, and it was only a matter of time before they made their move. But I wouldn&#39;t give them the chance to ruin everything I&#39;d worked for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling on my jacket, I left my room and made my way down the long corridor toward the dungeon. The air grew colder with each step, the dim lighting casting eerie shadows on the stone walls. My footsteps echoed, a rhythmic reminder of my power and control in this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached the heavy iron door, I paused for a moment, letting the satisfaction of what I was about to do wash over me. Lia had been a thorn in my side for far too long, and seeing her in that dark, damp cell was a pleasure I intended to savor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the door open, I stepped inside. The room smelled of damp stone and despair, and in the corner, Lia sat slumped against the wall, her once-bright eyes dulled by weeks of captivity. She looked up as I entered, and for a brief moment, something flickered in her gaze hope, maybe, or defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; she said, her voice hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled, crossing my arms as I leaned against the cell bars. &#34;Well, well, look at you,&#34; I said, smirking. &#34;How the mighty have fallen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia didn&#39;t respond, her lips pressing into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; I continued, &#34;I always thought you looked better in the light. But seeing you here, in the dark, helpless and broken it suits you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here, Dean?&#34; she asked, her voice stronger now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tilted my head, pretending to ponder her question. &#34;Why am I here? Good question. Maybe I just wanted to see you, Lia. Or maybe I wanted to remind you how you got here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened, and I could see the hatred burning in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could have had everything, you know,&#34; I said, stepping closer to the bars. &#34;You could have had me. But no, you had to go and choose Finn.&#34; I sneered, the name tasting bitter on my tongue. &#34;He wasn&#39;t good enough for you, Lia. He never was. So, I did what I had to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened slightly, and I knew she understood exactly what I was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed him,&#34; she whispered, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, feigning nonchalance. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t put it so bluntly, but yes, I made sure he was out of the picture. Permanently. And look where it got you, Lia. All alone, rotting in this cell. Was he worth it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands clenched into fists, her whole body trembling with anger. &#34;You&#39;re a monster,&#34; she spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, the sound echoing through the small space. &#34;Maybe I am. But I&#39;m a monster who gets what he wants. And right now, what I want is for you to confess. Alina&#39;s patience is wearing thin, and trust me, you don&#39;t want her to lose it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia didn&#39;t say anything, her gaze dropping to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched down, gripping the bars as I lowered my voice. &#34;You can end this, Lia. Just admit to everything, and maybe. just mJust I&#39;ll convince Alina to show you some mercy. But if you keep fighting, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head snapped up, and for a moment, I saw the fire in her eyes again. &#34;I&#39;ll never confess to something I didn&#39;t do,&#34; she said, her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, standing up and shaking my head. &#34;Suit yourself. But don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning on my heel, I walked out of the cell, my smirk returning as I heard her muttered curses behind me. Lia could fight all she wanted, but in the end, I would win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The echo of Dean&#39;s boots faded, leaving behind a suffocating silence that settled over the cold dungeon. His words still rang in my ears, cruel and venomous. He thought he&#39;d broken me. He thought locking me in here would silence me. But he was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned my head back against the damp stone wall, my mind racing. Dean&#39;s arrogance was his weakness. He always believed he was in control, but cracks were beginning to show in his carefully constructed facade. All I needed was a way to exploit them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of muffled voices outside the dungeon door snapped me out of my thoughts. The door creaked open, and two figures stepped inside. Bianca and Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened, my body tense. &#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked, my voice sharper than I intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here to help,&#34; Bianca said, her voice steady as she approached the bars of my cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed, shaking my head. &#34;Help? That&#39;s rich. The last time I trusted someone, I ended up in here. Forgive me if I&#39;m not exactly eager to jump at another opportunity to be betrayed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny folded her arms, her expression serious. &#34;We&#39;re not Dean. And we&#39;re not Alina. We don&#39;t have anything to gain from helping you, Lia. But we do have a lot to lose if we don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes, scrutinizing them both. &#34;And what exactly do you think you&#39;re going to lose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca stepped closer, her gaze unwavering. &#34;Everything. Alina and Dean are out of control. They&#39;re playing a dangerous game, and if we don&#39;t stop them, they&#39;ll destroy all of us. You included.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hung in the air, heavy with truth. But I wasn&#39;t ready to believe them. Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why should I trust you?&#34; I asked, my voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny exchanged a glance with Bianca before pulling out her phone. &#34;You don&#39;t have to trust us. But maybe you&#39;ll trust Luca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat at the mention of his name. &#34;Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nodded, taking the phone from Jenny and dialing a number. She held it out to me as it rang. &#34;Talk to him. Hear what he has to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, staring at the phone as if it might bite me. Then, cautiously, I reached through the bars and took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; Luca&#39;s voice came through the speaker, warm and familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat tightened, and for a moment, I couldn&#39;t speak. &#34;L-Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia!&#34; His voice was filled with relief. &#34;Thank god, you&#39;re okay. Are you hurt? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears pricked at my eyes as the sound of his voice washed over me like a balm. &#34;I... I don&#39;t know what to say. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever hear your voice again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here, Lia,&#34; he said firmly. &#34;And I&#39;m going to get you out of there. Bianca and Jenny told me everything. They&#39;re on our side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the two women, their expressions earnest. For the first time, a sliver of hope pierced through my doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You believe them?&#34; I asked Luca, my voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; he said without hesitation. &#34;They&#39;ve been risking a lot to help you, Lia. Trust them. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, letting his words sink in. Luca wouldn&#39;t lie to me. If he trusted them, then maybe I could too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said finally, my voice shaky but resolute. &#34;I&#39;ll trust them. For now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Luca said, his tone firm. &#34;Stay strong, Lia. We&#39;re going to bring you home. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears spilled over, and I quickly wiped them away. &#34;Thank you, Luca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead, and I handed the phone back to Bianca, my fingers trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got my attention,&#34; I said, my voice steadier now. &#34;What&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and Jenny exchanged a determined glance before turning back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to take Alina and Dean down,&#34; Jenny said, her voice filled with conviction. &#34;And you&#39;re going to help us do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first ti</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me in what felt like forever, I felt a spark of hope ignite in my chest. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn&#39;t as alone as I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>157</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Lia&#39;s voice had done something to me. It was as if the weight of the entire world had lifted, even if just for a moment. She was alive. She was strong, though I could tell she was barely holding on. That was all I needed to ignite the fire in me. I wouldn&#39;t stop until she was out of that dungeon and safe in my arms again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat at my desk, Bianca and Jenny&#39;s videos and pictures of the dungeon laid out before me. The images showed every detail the cold, damp walls, the heavy iron bars, the chains. Each photo made my blood boil, but I forced myself to stay calm. This wasn&#39;t the time for emotions. It was time for action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I transferred the files to multiple systems, uploading them to encrypted drives and saving them on several flash drives. Losing this evidence wasn&#39;t an option. Dean would stop at nothing to keep his secrets buried, and I wasn&#39;t going to let him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta,&#34; I called out, and moments later, she entered the room, her brow furrowed in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I handed her a small stack of flash drives. &#34;I need you to hide these in the cellar under your house. Make sure they&#39;re somewhere no one would think to look. Dean can&#39;t find these, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened as she took the drives. &#34;Luca, what are you planning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything,&#34; I said simply. &#34;And nothing he&#39;ll see coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated but nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll keep them safe. But you need to be careful. Dean isn&#39;t someone to underestimate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, standing and stretching. The tension in my body refused to leave, but I couldn&#39;t afford to let it show. &#34;Which is why I&#39;m going to meet him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; she exclaimed, her voice rising in alarm. &#34;Are you out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a choice,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Dean thinks he&#39;s untouchable. If I want to bring him down, I need to get close enough to gather more evidence. Bianca and Jenny&#39;s help has been invaluable, but it&#39;s not enough. I need his words, his confessions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you think he&#39;ll just hand them to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not exactly,&#34; I said, pulling a small microchip from my pocket. &#34;This will record everything. I&#39;ll plant it on his clothes during our meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta looked at me like I&#39;d lost my mind. &#34;And what happens when he figures out what you&#39;re doing? Luca, this is dangerous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said softly, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. &#34;But I don&#39;t have another option. If I don&#39;t do this, Lia stays in that dungeon. And I&#39;m not letting that happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shoulders slumped, and she let out a shaky breath. &#34;Fine. But promise me you&#39;ll be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; I assured her. &#34;But you need to be watchful too. Dean is sneaky, and if he suspects anything, he might try something while I&#39;m gone. Stay alert, and keep Merlin close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression hardened, and she nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll watch him like a hawk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I grabbed my jacket and slipped the microchip into the inner pocket. My heart pounded in my chest, but I pushed the fear aside. This wasn&#39;t about me. It was about Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stepped out of the house, I turned back to Benedicta one last time. &#34;If anything happens, don&#39;t wait for me. Call Luca or Bianca. They&#39;ll know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing will happen,&#34; she said, her voice firm. &#34;But I&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, satisfied, and headed to the car. The drive to meet Dean felt longer than it should have, every passing second weighing on me. My mind raced with scenarios, each more dangerous than the last. But I clung to the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean had no idea what was coming. He thought he held all the power, but he&#39;d underestimated me. This wasn&#39;t just about saving Lia it was about justice. Dean needed to pay for everything he&#39;d done, and I was going to make sure he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I approached the meeting point, I took a deep breath, steeling myself. This was just the beginning. I had to play the part, act as if nothing was wrong, all while collecting every word, every slip-up, every detail that could bring him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Lia. For justice. For freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped out of the car, the microchip safely tucked in my pocket, and made my way to the meeting spot. The game was on, and I was ready to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couch beneath me offered little comfort. For hours, I&#39;d been trying to rest, but my mind wouldn&#39;t let me. The weight of everything-the secrets, the lies, the constant juggling of power-pressed down like a vice on my chest. I leaned back, closing my eyes, but even that didn&#39;t offer reprieve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes, irritated. Reaching for it, I glanced at the caller ID. Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of me wanted to ignore it, let him stew in whatever thoughts had driven him to contact me. But I couldn&#39;t. Luca wasn&#39;t someone you brushed aside-not when he was involved with something as delicate as Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; I answered, my voice curt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to meet,&#34; he said, his tone calm but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for him to elaborate, but he didn&#39;t. He never gave more than necessary. That was Luca-controlled, calculating, and always several steps ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me the location, and I ended the call without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood, stretching out the stiffness in my body before heading to the closet. Pulling out a dark shirt and slacks, I dressed quickly, mentally rehearsing my alibi. If Alina asked where I was going-or where I&#39;d been later-I&#39;d tell her I needed to unwind. To clear my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t press. Alina knew better than to question me when I was in this mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding my shoes on, I grabbed my car keys and stepped outside. The crisp night air met me as I approached the sleek black car waiting in the driveway. I got in, started the engine, and pulled out onto the empty road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the city lights blurred past, my mind began dissecting the situation. Why had Luca called me? What did he want?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tapped my fingers against the steering wheel, my grip tightening. Luca wasn&#39;t stupid. He wouldn&#39;t reach out unless he had a reason-a good one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of our last conversation resurfaced, that heated moment when I&#39;d let my guard down and confessed to killing Finn. A mistake, no matter how fleeting. Luca was too sharp to let something like that slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, frustration bubbling beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t how things were supposed to go. I&#39;d been careful, meticulous in covering my tracks. But Luca had a way of unraveling even the most carefully laid plans. He was like a shadow-silent, persistent, and impossible to shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the GPS, noting I was nearing the meeting point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever he had planned, I needed to be ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The location he&#39;d chosen was secluded, dimly lit by a single flickering streetlamp. My instincts flared. It felt too perfect for a setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked the car but didn&#39;t step out immediately. Reaching for my phone, I dialed Luca&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alone?&#34; I asked when he picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why do you want to meet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To negotiate. About Lia. Nothing else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed silent for a moment, weighing his words. Negotiate? Luca rarely used that word. He was direct, preferring action over diplomacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scanned the area through the windshield, my unease growing. Negotiation or not, Luca wasn&#39;t to be underestimated. He&#39;d do whatever it took to protect Lia-even if it meant crossing lines he&#39;d never considered before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t one to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s pause, I opened the car door, stepping out into the cool night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each step I took toward the meeting point was calculated, and deliberate. I wouldn&#39;t give him the satisfaction of catching me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, I&#39;d be ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>158</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was heavy as I waited at the secluded spot I had chosen for the meeting. The dim glow of the streetlamp above barely illuminated the area, making it the perfect place for a private confrontation. My fingers drummed against my thigh as I replayed the plan in my mind. Dean wasn&#39;t stupid-he&#39;d be on guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the faint hum of an approaching car and looked up, spotting Dean&#39;s black vehicle as it rolled to a stop a few feet away. He didn&#39;t step out immediately. I knew he&#39;d call first, testing the waters. My phone vibrated, and I answered it on the first ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alone?&#34; Dean&#39;s voice was clipped, suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I replied evenly, keeping my tone calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To negotiate. About Lia. Nothing else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause before I heard his car door open. I slid my phone back into my pocket, watching as he approached. His steps were measured and deliberate. Dean always carried himself like a predator, confident and ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have five minutes, Luca,&#34; he said as he stopped a few feet away from me. &#34;Say what you need to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squared my shoulders, refusing to let his imposing demeanor intimidate me. &#34;You know why I called you here, Dean. This is about Lia. Let her go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean smirked, his lips curling into that smug expression I&#39;d grown to hate. &#34;And why would I do that? She&#39;s exactly where she belongs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we both know the charges against her are fabricated,&#34; I shot back. &#34;You&#39;re the one pulling the strings, Dean. Just name your price, and I&#39;ll pay it. Whatever it takes to set her free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smirk deepened, and he took a step closer. &#34;Whatever it takes? That&#39;s a bold offer, Luca. But you see, it&#39;s not about money or power. It&#39;s about Lia. She made her choice, and it wasn&#39;t me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms as I forced myself to stay calm. &#34;This isn&#39;t about the past, Dean. It&#39;s about doing what&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right?&#34; He let out a bitter laugh. &#34;Do you even hear yourself? What&#39;s right doesn&#39;t matter in this game. You should know that by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, my jaw tightening. &#34;You killed Finn, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes narrowed, but he didn&#39;t deny it. Instead, he tilted his head, a sly grin spreading across his face. &#34;And if I did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re admitting it, then,&#34; I said, my voice sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in slightly, his tone dropping to a low, mocking whisper. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter if I admit it, Luca. Alina won&#39;t believe you. You can scream it from the rooftops, show her evidence, and she&#39;ll still take my side. You&#39;re wasting your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stung because I knew there was truth to them. Alina was blinded by her loyalty to Dean, no matter how dark his deeds were. But I couldn&#39;t let that stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She deserves to know,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;And I&#39;ll make sure she does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s expression darkened for a moment before he chuckled softly. &#34;Enough of this,&#34; he said. &#34;You said you wanted to negotiate. So, what are you offering?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything,&#34; I said without hesitation. &#34;Whatever you want, just let Lia go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze sharpened, and for a moment, he seemed to be considering my words. But then his smile returned, cruel and calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want money, Luca. I don&#39;t want power. What I want is Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach twisted at his words, and I took an instinctive step forward. &#34;She&#39;s not yours to have, Dean. You can&#39;t force her to love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love has nothing to do with it,&#34; he snapped. &#34;She&#39;ll stay with me because I say so. She&#39;ll learn to obey, to respect me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re delusional,&#34; I said, my voice rising. &#34;You think you can control her, but Lia&#39;s stronger than you realize. She&#39;ll never be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smirk faltered, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of something else-anger, frustration. &#34;You think you can save her?&#34; he said, his tone cold. &#34;You think you&#39;re some kind of hero?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think, Dean. I know I can save her,&#34; I replied, my voice steady. &#34;And I will, no matter what it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stood there in tense silence, the weight of our words hanging between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This conversation is over,&#34; Dean finally said, stepping back. &#34;You&#39;ve wasted enough of my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop him as he turned and walked away. But as I watched him go, I felt a renewed sense of determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean might think he held all the cards, but he didn&#39;t know me as well as he thought. I wasn&#39;t backing down-not until Lia was free and he was exposed for the monster he truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s phone buzzed on the table, shattering the uneasy silence between us. I glanced at her, and she gave me a small nod before picking it up. The name on the screen flashed &#34;Luca.&#34; My heartbeat quickened. If Luca was calling now, it had to be important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny swiped to answer, putting the call on speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; she said, her voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen carefully,&#34; Luca&#39;s voice came through, low and urgent. &#34;Dean&#39;s more dangerous than we thought. I managed to record part of my meeting with him. I&#39;m sending you the audio now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and I exchanged a look. Luca&#39;s words sent a chill down my spine. I grabbed the phone, my hands shaking slightly as I spoke. &#34;What else did he say, Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He admitted to killing Finn,&#34; Luca said, his voice hard. &#34;But he&#39;s confident no one will believe it. Alina is blind to his faults, and Dean knows it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw clenched. Finn&#39;s murder had haunted us all, but now that we knew the truth, the weight of it was almost unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; Jenny said, her voice trembling slightly, &#34;what do we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you two to be my eyes and ears,&#34; Luca said firmly. &#34;Follow Dean&#39;s movements, dig into his activities, and find something solid something undeniable. We need evidence that can&#39;t be ignored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, though Luca couldn&#39;t see her. &#34;Got it. Send us the audio,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already done,&#34; he replied. &#34;Be careful. Dean&#39;s not stupid, and he won&#39;t hesitate to hurt anyone who gets in his way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, leaving an air of tension in the room. Seconds later, Jenny&#39;s phone chimed with the incoming file. She opened it, and we listened to the recording in silence. Dean&#39;s voice was unmistakable, laced with arrogance and malice as he confessed to Finn&#39;s murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my blood boil. Finn didn&#39;t deserve this. He had been good-kind. He loved Lia, and now his life was reduced to nothing more than a power play for Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we processed Luca&#39;s instructions, the faint sound of a car engine reached my ears. I stiffened, glancing out the window. Headlights illuminated the driveway as a sleek black car came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; I whispered, my voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny turned to me, her eyes wide. &#34;What do we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle him,&#34; I said, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I cut her off, my tone firm. &#34;I need to do this. Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her reply, I headed toward the door. My mind raced as I thought about how to approach him. Dean was cunning, but I knew how to play his game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stepped outside, Dean was already getting out of his car. He shut the door with a soft thud and turned to me, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; he greeted, his voice calm but sharp. &#34;What brings you out here at this hour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms, schooling my features into an indifferent mask. &#34;I should be asking you that. Where are you coming from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips. &#34;Since when do I report to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you started acting suspicious,&#34; I shot back. &#34;You disappear without explanation, and then Finn dies? You can&#39;t expect me not to wonder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled darkly, taking a step closer. &#34;You&#39;re pretending, Bianca. You don&#39;t care about Finn, not really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach twisted, but I kept my expression neutral. &#34;And what makes you think that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I know you,&#34; Dean said, his tone dripping with confidence. &#34;You&#39;re not mourning Finn. You&#39;re angry because you didn&#39;t have him. You loved him, didn&#39;t you? But he was too blinded by Lia to notice you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hit harder than I expected, but I refused to show it. Instead, I leaned into the act, letting my bitterness show. &#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; I said, my voice low. &#34;I loved Finn. I wanted him, but Lia stole him from me. So don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m pretending. I want her to rot in that cell just as much as you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as if he were trying to decipher whether I was lying or not. &#34;Is that so?&#34; he asked, his voice softer now, almost mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not curious about who actually killed him. Was it you, Dean? Did you do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smirk returned, cold and cruel. &#34;You&#39;re playing a dangerous game, Bianca. Be careful where you tread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, my pulse racing as I held his gaze. His non-answer was answered enough. He had killed Finn, but he wasn&#39;t going to admit it outright not here, not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I am,&#34; I said evenly. &#34;But you should be careful too, Dean. People are watching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I turned and walked back toward the house, my heart pounding in my chest. Dean&#39;s eyes burned into my back, but I didn&#39;t look back. This was far from over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>159</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the dungeon gate creaking open jolted me awake. My eyes snapped toward the iron bars, and I sat up on the cold, damp cot, my heart pounding. The rusted hinges screeched, echoing ominously in the silence of the room. A tall guard stepped in, followed by a maid clutching a tray of food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat,&#34; the maid said curtly, placing the tray on the ground with a loud thud. Her eyes were cold as they met mine. &#34;You&#39;ll need your strength for today. Lady Alina has plans for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach twisted at her words, but I didn&#39;t show it. I glared at her instead. &#34;What plans?&#34; I asked sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid smirked. &#34;You&#39;ll see soon enough,&#34; she said. &#34;After all, killers don&#39;t deserve comfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill anyone!&#34; I shot back, the chains around my wrists clinking as I stood. My voice echoed in the small cell. &#34;So, you better watch your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid laughed bitterly, her voice grating on my nerves. &#34;Save your lies for someone who cares,&#34; she said. &#34;Everyone knows what you did. You&#39;re nothing but a murderer. A liar. You deserve no peace, no pity, and no mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step forward, my hands trembling with rage. &#34;Say that again,&#34; I challenged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed as she raised her hand as if to strike me. I flinched but held my ground, ready to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; Bianca&#39;s voice rang out, cutting through the tension like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid froze her hand still in the air. Both of us turned to see Bianca standing at the entrance, her expression dark with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; Bianca demanded, her voice cold and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid stammered, &#34;I-I was just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just what?&#34; Bianca interrupted, stepping closer. &#34;Overstepping your bounds? Who gave you the right to touch her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid lowered her gaze, but Bianca wasn&#39;t finished. &#34;Get out,&#34; she ordered her voice firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid hesitated, her lips parting as if to protest, but Bianca&#39;s glare silenced her. She grabbed the empty tray and scurried out of the cell, her footsteps fading quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca turned to the guard next. &#34;Leave us,&#34; she commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard hesitated, his eyes darting between Bianca and me, but eventually, he nodded and exited the cell, closing the gate behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Bianca, confusion and suspicion swirling in my mind. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I asked, my voice rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed, running a hand through her hair. &#34;Trying to stop you from getting killed,&#34; she said bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed, crossing my arms. &#34;Why? So you can feel better about yourself? Spare me the act, Bianca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened, but she didn&#39;t respond right away. Instead, she moved to the corner of the cell and leaned against the wall. &#34;I&#39;m not here to argue with you,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m here because I know you didn&#39;t kill Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stunned me into silence. I searched her face for any hint of deceit, but she seemed sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you know that, then why am I still here?&#34; I asked bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because proving it isn&#39;t easy,&#34; she admitted. &#34;Dean&#39;s got everyone convinced that you&#39;re guilty. And Alina she&#39;s not exactly the forgiving type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed humorlessly. &#34;Tell me something I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca sighed again, her gaze softening. &#34;Look, I&#39;m trying to help you,&#34; she said. &#34;But I can&#39;t do it alone. You need to trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust you?&#34; I repeated, my voice rising. &#34;How can I trust you when you&#39;re part of the same group that put me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t flinch at my accusation. Instead, she stepped closer, her eyes locking onto mine. &#34;You don&#39;t have a choice,&#34; she said simply. &#34;Unless you&#39;d rather rot here and let them win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her, my heart pounding. She wasn&#39;t wrong. As much as I hated to admit it, I didn&#39;t have any other options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your plan?&#34; I asked reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile tugged at her lips, but it didn&#39;t reach her eyes. &#34;First, we need to figure out what Alina&#39;s planning for you. And then&#34; She trailed off, her expression hardening. &#34;Then we find a way to expose Dean for the snake he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words ignited a flicker of hope in my chest, but I quickly squashed it. I couldn&#39;t afford to get my hopes up, not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still don&#39;t trust you,&#34; I said, my voice quiet but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nodded. &#34;Fair enough,&#34; she said. &#34;But trust or not, I&#39;m not leaving you to face this alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her determination caught me off guard. For the first time since I&#39;d been thrown into this dungeon, I felt a sliver of hope. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn&#39;t as alone as I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim light of the dungeon made Lia&#39;s face look even paler than I remembered. I crouched next to her, lowering my voice so no one outside could hear. &#34;Lia,&#34; I began, &#34;I need you to stay strong. We&#39;re working on a plan to get you out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me skeptically, her eyes sunken from exhaustion. &#34;What plan? Bianca, do you really think there&#39;s a way out of this? Dean has everyone convinced I killed Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned closer. &#34;Listen to me. Luca, Jenny, and I had a meeting last night. We&#39;re gathering evidence against Dean. Luca already recorded him confessing to killing Finn. We&#39;re careful, but we&#39;re making progress. It&#39;s only a matter of time before we expose him for the liar and murderer he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips trembled as she absorbed my words. &#34;You&#39;re serious?&#34; she whispered, her voice cracking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, gripping her hand tightly. &#34;Dead serious. We&#39;ve already started. Luca sent us recordings, and we&#39;re tracking Dean&#39;s moves. Trust me, Lia. This isn&#39;t over yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in days, a faint flicker of hope lit her eyes. &#34;Thank you,&#34; she said, her voice barely audible. &#34;Thank you for believing in me. I was starting to lose hope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart ached at her words, but I forced a reassuring smile. &#34;You&#39;re not alone in this. We&#39;re going to get you out of here, no matter what it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded weakly, and I stood, glancing at the door to ensure the coast was still clear. &#34;Hang in there. I&#39;ll check on you soon,&#34; I said, giving her one last look before leaving the dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I made my way to the breakfast room, my mind raced. Dean&#39;s confidence was his weakness. He didn&#39;t realize we were closing in on him, and I planned to use that to my advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered the dining room, I was immediately met with a sight that made my blood boil. Dean was seated at the table with Alina and Jenny, eating as if he owned the place. How dare he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is Dean eating here?&#34; I asked, my tone sharp as I approached the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina looked up from her plate, her expression cool and dismissive. &#34;Bianca, mind your business,&#34; she said, her voice dripping with disdain. &#34;Besides, you&#39;re not really part of this family, so you should know your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stung more than I cared to admit, but I refused to show it. Instead, I squared my shoulders and pulled out a chair, sitting down across from Dean without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny glanced at me, her eyes full of unspoken understanding. We were both walking a tightrope, pretending to tolerate Dean while working behind the scenes to take him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I picked at my food, I couldn&#39;t help but steal glances at Dean. He looked calm, almost smug as if he had nothing to hide. It made my stomach churn. He was a murderer, sitting at this table as if he belonged, while Lia rotted in a dungeon for his crime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fork tightly, resisting the urge to say something that might give us away. Alina&#39;s presence didn&#39;t make things easier. She was firmly in Dean&#39;s corner, blindly loyal to him despite everything. Confronting him now would be useless and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nudged my foot under the table, breaking my train of thought. I glanced at her and caught the subtle raise of her eyebrow, a silent reminder to stay focused. We had a plan, and we needed to stick to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath and forced myself to relax. Dean&#39;s arrogance would be his downfall, and I had no intention of tipping him off before the time was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, as I sat there, pretending to eat, I couldn&#39;t shake the anger boiling inside me. Dean might think he was untouchable, but he was wrong. Luca, Jenny, and I were closing in, and it was only a matter of time before his lies unraveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Jenny again, and this time, she gave me a faint nod. It was a small gesture, but it was enough to remind me of what we were fighting for. Lia&#39;s freedom, Finn&#39;s justice, and the truth no matter the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean might be sitting there now, acting like he had nothing to fear, but his days were numbered. And when the truth finally came out, he&#39;d have nowhere to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>160</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I poured Merlin another glass of orange juice as he bit into his toast. His small hands fumbled to balance the slice, and I couldn&#39;t help but smile. These quiet breakfasts with him had become my anchor amidst the storm that had engulfed our lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom&#39;s taking too long to come back,&#34; Merlin said, his voice tinged with the innocence of a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, setting my cup down. &#34;She&#39;ll be back soon,&#34; I said softly, keeping my tone light. &#34;She just had to travel for something important. But she&#39;s coming back, Merlin. You&#39;ll see her soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded reluctantly, his little face pensive as he focused on his plate. Watching him like this made my chest tighten. He deserved none of this chaos, none of the lies or danger that had seeped into our home. I wanted so badly to protect him from all of it, but the secrets we kept were growing heavier by the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I reached for my coffee, the doorbell rang. My body stiffened instantly. Who could it be this early in the morning? I glanced at Merlin, who looked just as curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here, okay? I&#39;ll check who it is,&#34; I said quickly, rising from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking toward the door, I took a calming breath before opening it. What I saw made my heart stop. A man stood there tall, broad-shouldered, with a cold, calculating gaze that sent shivers down my spine. He didn&#39;t belong here, and I knew instantly that this wasn&#39;t a casual visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved into a humorless smile. &#34;I have a message from my boss,&#34; he said smoothly, ignoring my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instinctively turned slightly to glance at Merlin, who was craning his neck to see what was going on. My mind raced. Whatever this man wanted, I couldn&#39;t let Merlin get dragged into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does your boss want?&#34; I asked calmly, even though my heart was pounding in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man held out a folded piece of paper. &#34;This is an address,&#34; he said. &#34;You need to be there with the boy at the time written on it. If you&#39;re late or don&#39;t show up, you&#39;ll never see Lia again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hit me like a punch to the gut, but I kept my expression neutral. I couldn&#39;t afford to show weakness. &#34;Understood,&#34; I said, taking the paper from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s smile widened slightly as if he was enjoying the power he held in this moment. Then, without another word, he turned and walked away, disappearing down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the door closed, I reached for my phone and called Luca. My hands trembled as I dialed his number, but I managed to keep my voice steady when he picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I said quickly, &#34;a man just came to the house. He said he had a message from his boss and handed me an address. He wants me to bring Merlin there at a specific time. He threatened Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw everything,&#34; Luca replied, his voice calm but firm. &#34;The security cameras caught it all. I&#39;m already on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flooded through me, but it was short-lived. The situation was far from over. &#34;Thank you,&#34; I said quietly before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back toward the dining room, where Merlin was still sitting at the table, looking up at me with wide, curious eyes. &#34;Who was that?&#34; he asked, his tone innocent but laced with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a smile, shoving the paper into my pocket. &#34;Just someone dropping off a message,&#34; I said casually, ruffling his hair as I walked past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of message?&#34; he pressed, his curiosity unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing important,&#34; I said lightly, sitting back down at the table. &#34;Now, finish your breakfast. You have a busy day ahead, young man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin gave me a skeptical look but eventually returned to his toast. I watched him quietly, my mind racing as I tried to piece everything together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s visit was a clear warning. Whoever his boss was, they were escalating things, and Lia&#39;s life hung in the balance. But Luca was already on it, and I trusted him to handle the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, I needed to focus on keeping Merlin calm and safe. As I sat there, sipping my now-cold coffee, I couldn&#39;t help but feel the weight of everything pressing down on me. Lia, Merlin, the lies we were all tangled in it was all spiraling out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter what, I wouldn&#39;t let fear take over. I&#39;d protect Merlin with everything I had, and I&#39;d fight for Lia&#39;s freedom. These people might think they could intimidate me, but they were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had already sent a team to tail the man who had visited Benedicta&#39;s house. It was crucial not to lose him, especially after the threat he delivered to her. My instructions were clear follow his car, intercept him at a safe spot, and knock him out without drawing attention. There was no room for error.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call from my team came just as I was nearing the safe house. &#34;We&#39;ve got him, boss,&#34; one of them confirmed. &#34;He&#39;s unconscious, and we&#39;re heading to the designated location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I replied curtly. &#34;Secure him there, and make sure no one knows what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, I arrived at the location. The place was desolate, perfect for what I had planned. The man was already tied to a chair, slumped over, but breathing. My men stood guard, ensuring no interruptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out my phone, I called Jenny. Her voice came through after the second ring. &#34;Luca, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got an update,&#34; I said, pacing the dimly lit room. &#34;The man who threatened Benedicta has been captured. I&#39;m sending you and Bianca a picture now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped a quick photo of the unconscious man, his face bruised from the struggle. &#34;We&#39;re going to use him as leverage against Dean,&#34; I explained. &#34;The only way to free Lia is to set Dean up. We need Alina to see him for the monster he really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny hesitated before replying, &#34;And how do you plan to do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll blackmail Dean,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;This guy is our key. I&#39;ll make Dean think we&#39;ve got information that could ruin him, and I&#39;ll bait him into meeting me. Once we&#39;re face-to-face, I&#39;ll provoke him. Dean&#39;s pride is his weakness he won&#39;t be able to stop himself from saying too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what if he doesn&#39;t take the bait?&#34; Bianca chimed in, having joined the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked. &#34;He will. He thinks he&#39;s untouchable, but he won&#39;t risk whatever he&#39;s hiding getting out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, looking at the man tied to the chair. &#34;I&#39;ll also have cameras set up at the meeting point. If Dean admits to anything anything at all I&#39;ll send the footage to Alina anonymously. Once she sees the truth, Lia will be free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence on the other end before Bianca spoke. &#34;It&#39;s risky, but it might work. Just be careful, Luca. Dean isn&#39;t the type to go down without a fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I replied, my voice hard. &#34;That&#39;s why I need you and Jenny to keep an eye on Alina. If this goes south, she might try to protect Dean, even if she knows the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve got it covered,&#34; Jenny assured me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ending the call, I turned back to the man. He was starting to stir, groaning softly as he regained consciousness. &#34;Wake him up,&#34; I ordered my men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them splashed cold water on his face, jolting him fully awake. His eyes darted around the room in panic before landing on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who who are you?&#34; he stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your worst nightmare if you don&#39;t cooperate,&#34; I said coldly, leaning in close. &#34;You delivered a message to Benedicta. Now you&#39;re going to deliver one for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s eyes widened, but I didn&#39;t give him a chance to respond. I took another photo of him, making sure his bound hands were visible, and sent it directly to Dean. Along with the picture, I typed out a message:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meet me at the address below. You know what happens if you don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I included the location of an abandoned warehouse I&#39;d scouted earlier. Dean wouldn&#39;t dare ignore this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I hit send, I felt a surge of anticipation. This was the moment that could turn everything around. Dean had been untouchable for too long, but his arrogance would be his downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to my men, I gave them final instructions. &#34;Keep this guy alive, but don&#39;t let him out of your sight. If anything goes wrong, I&#39;ll need him as insurance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them nodded. &#34;Understood, boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped outside to wait for Dean&#39;s response, the cool night air biting against my skin. The minutes dragged on, each one heavier than the last. Finally, my phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was brief but telling: &#34;I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grim smile spread across my face. Everything was falling into place. Now it was up to me to see it through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I leaned against the hood of my car, I couldn&#39;t help but think of Lia. She&#39;d endured so much because of Dean&#39;s lies and manipulations. She didn&#39;t deserve this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, determination hardening my resolve. Today wasn&#39;t just about setting her free it was about justice. Dean&#39;s reign of terror was coming to an end, and I&#39;d make sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Lia. For Benedicta. For everyone, Dean had ever hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if he thought he could outsmart me, he was about to learn just how wrong he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>161</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was suffocating as I stormed into my room, slamming the door shut behind me. My mind was spinning, the weight of the picture Luca had sent me pressing heavily on my chest. How had things spiraled so far out of control? I didn&#39;t know what Luca thought he was doing, but whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t going to end well for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked open my closet, grabbed a crisp shirt, and threw it on, my movements sharp and deliberate. My hands trembled slightly, but I pushed the unease aside. I needed to focus. If Luca wanted to play games, I&#39;d play. But I&#39;d make sure he regretted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I fastened the last button on my shirt, there was a knock at the door. I froze for a second, letting out a frustrated sigh before opening it. Alina stood there, her arms crossed, her eyes narrowing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where are you heading off to in such a rush?&#34; she asked, her voice carrying a note of suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to get out for a bit,&#34; I said, keeping my tone neutral. &#34;Clear my head. Everything going on has been... a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes softened slightly, but I could still see the doubt lingering there. &#34;You&#39;re not planning anything reckless, are you? We need to stay united now more than ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a small, tired smile. &#34;Reckless? No. I just need some air, Alina. I&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to hesitate, her gaze searching my face for any sign of deceit, but I didn&#39;t flinch. Finally, she nodded, stepping aside. &#34;Fine. But don&#39;t take too long. There&#39;s still a lot to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I murmured, brushing past her and heading for the car park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I approached my car, I spotted Bianca and Jenny standing near one of the other vehicles, deep in conversation. My steps faltered slightly, but I quickly composed myself and walked past them, hoping they wouldn&#39;t notice me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean!&#34; Bianca&#39;s voice called out, stopping me in my tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned slowly, my expression blank. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you off to?&#34; she asked, her tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out,&#34; I said curtly, not in the mood for their interrogation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny stepped forward, her arms crossed. &#34;Out? Care to elaborate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I snapped, my patience thinning. &#34;It&#39;s none of your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca raised an eyebrow, exchanging a look with Jenny. &#34;We&#39;re just curious. You&#39;ve been acting... strange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;I don&#39;t owe you an explanation. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, I turned on my heel and climbed into my car, slamming the door shut. As I started the engine, I caught a glimpse of the two of them watching me, their expressions unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the location Luca had sent was tense, the silence in the car broken only by the hum of the engine. My grip on the steering wheel tightened as I replayed the events of the past few days in my mind. I couldn&#39;t let him get the upper hand. Whatever he thought he had on me, I&#39;d make sure it wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally pulled up to the abandoned building, I parked the car and sat for a moment, my heart pounding. This wasn&#39;t how I&#39;d envisioned things going. But if Luca wanted to confront me, then so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my phone and dialed his number, the tension building with every ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here,&#34; he said when he answered, his voice calm, almost taunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; I demanded, my eyes scanning the building&#39;s exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Inside,&#34; he replied. &#34;Come in. Let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hung in the air as the line went dead. I shoved the phone into my pocket and stepped out of the car, taking a deep breath. Whatever game Luca was playing, he&#39;d soon realize I wasn&#39;t one to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in the chair, my arms crossed as I stared at the door. The faint sound of footsteps echoed in the distance, growing louder with each step. My eyes narrowed, anticipation simmering beneath my calm exterior. Dean was finally here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, and there he was his expression a mixture of anger and wariness. His gaze flicked around the room before landing on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got some nerve,&#34; he said, walking closer. &#34;What the hell is this about, Luca? Why did you abduct my man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, rising slowly from the chair. &#34;Why did you send him to Benedicta&#39;s house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean scoffed, his eyes narrowing. &#34;Merlin is my son. I have every right to want to see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your son?&#34; I repeated, my voice dripping with disbelief. &#34;You mean the child you conveniently ignored until now? Spare me the excuses, Dean. We both know this has nothing to do with Merlin and everything to do with your desperation to cover your tracks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean stiffened, but his voice remained cold. &#34;What do you want, Luca? What&#39;s your endgame here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer, keeping my gaze locked on his. &#34;It&#39;s simple. I&#39;ll let go of Lia. I&#39;ll even go far away and disappear from your life and everyone else&#39;s. But only on one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head, suspicion evident in his eyes. &#34;And what condition is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You destroy the gun,&#34; I said, my voice steady. &#34;The same gun you used to kill Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Finn&#39;s name made his face twitch, though he quickly masked his reaction. &#34;Why would I do that?&#34; he asked, his tone laced with skepticism. &#34;Why should I trust you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached into my pocket, pulled out my travel documents, and held them up for him to see. &#34;This is my visa to Puerto Rico. I boarded a flight three days after... everything. I&#39;ve got nothing to lose, Dean. All I need is your agreement. Destroy the gun, and I&#39;ll leave peacefully. No more games, no more threats.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at the documents for a moment, his expression unreadable. Then his gaze shifted back to me. &#34;And I&#39;m supposed to just take your word for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled, shaking my head. &#34;Dean, this isn&#39;t about trust. It&#39;s about survival. Do you want to keep Alina in the dark about who you really are? Fine. But as long as that gun exists, you&#39;re vulnerable. Destroy it, and I&#39;m out of your hair for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to consider my words, his jaw tightening as he weighed his options. The room fell silent, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he exhaled sharply and nodded. &#34;Fine. We have a deal. But if you cross me, Luca-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised a hand, cutting him off. &#34;Save your threats, Dean. I know exactly who I&#39;m dealing with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed, but he didn&#39;t respond. I watched as the tension in his shoulders eased slightly, the smallest crack in his otherwise unshakable facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said, slipping the documents back into my pocket. &#34;Then let&#39;s get this over with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in years, it felt like I had the upper hand. But I knew better than to trust Dean entirely. This was just the beginning, and I was prepared for whatever came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>162</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon hung high in the sky as I led Luca through the winding path behind my property. The forest was eerily silent, save for the crunch of leaves under our feet. My heart pounded in my chest, but my face betrayed none of my inner turmoil. This was all part of the plan, and I wasn&#39;t about to let Luca suspect a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes, I stopped abruptly. &#34;It&#39;s here,&#34; I said, pointing to a spot on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca stood back, arms crossed, his piercing gaze fixed on me. I ignored him and picked up the shovel I&#39;d brought along, plunging it into the earth. The damp soil gave way easily as I dug, my muscles straining with each movement. Minutes felt like hours as the hole grew deeper until finally, the edge of a metal box came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled it out, brushing the dirt off the surface before unlocking it. Inside was a gun-clean, shiny, and deliberately placed. I held it up for Luca to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here it is,&#34; I said, my voice even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes narrowed as he stepped closer. &#34;This is the gun?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the gun,&#34; I confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, I walked back to my car and retrieved a hammer from the trunk. Placing the gun on a flat rock nearby, I lifted the hammer high and brought it down with a resounding crack. The sound echoed through the forest as the gun&#39;s frame bent under the force. Strike after strike, I ensured the weapon was nothing more than a mangled mess of metal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca watched in silence, his expression unreadable. When I was done, I straightened and turned to him. &#34;Satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head slightly. &#34;And what about the gun you used to frame Lia? Is this it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met his gaze without flinching. &#34;This is the same gun. There&#39;s no other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he just stared at me, as if trying to decipher some hidden meaning in my words. Then, he gave a small nod. &#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked back to our cars in silence. The tension was thick, but I kept my composure, knowing this encounter was far from over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I climbed into my car, I glanced in the rearview mirror, watching Luca drive off into the darkness. A slow smile crept onto my face, followed by a low chuckle that grew into full-blown laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually believed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started the engine and took a long, winding route to a location only I knew. This was my sanctuary, my secret place where I kept things I couldn&#39;t afford to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hideout was small and unassuming, tucked away in a dense thicket of trees. I parked the car and walked inside, the weight of the evening&#39;s events finally lifting as I approached a hidden panel in the wall. Behind it was another safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered the code with practiced ease, the lock clicking open to reveal the real prize: the gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weapon gleamed under the dim light, its significance heavy in my hands. This was the gun that could destroy Lia&#39;s life-or save it, depending on how I chose to play my cards. I turned it over in my hands, a triumphant smile spreading across my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice try, Luca,&#34; I murmured to myself, placing the gun back into the safe and securing it tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was far from over, but for now, I allowed myself a moment of satisfaction. Luca thought he&#39;d outsmarted me, but this game was mine to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stepped out of the hideout and locked the door behind me, the cool night air filled my lungs. I felt invincible, the weight of the evening&#39;s charade fading into the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a game of survival-it was a game of strategy, and I had just made my move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>_____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the call connected, Jenny&#39;s voice came through, steady but tinged with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you get the video?&#34; I asked, gripping the steering wheel tightly as I navigated the dark streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we did,&#34; Jenny confirmed. &#34;It&#39;s clear as day. He&#39;s digging something out of the ground. What&#39;s the next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the small tracker display on my dashboard, which showed Dean&#39;s location in real time. The chip I had planted on his coat was working flawlessly. &#34;Keep watching for any new movements. I have a feeling this isn&#39;t over yet. That bastard might think he&#39;s smart, but he doesn&#39;t know who he&#39;s messing with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Jenny replied before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I pulled up in front of Benedicta&#39;s house, I took a deep breath, centering myself. I had to get her and Merlin out of here immediately. Dean was unpredictable, and with the way things were escalating, there was no telling what he might do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped out of the car and walked briskly to the door. The tension in the air was palpable as Benedicta opened it, her eyes widening in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go. Now,&#34; I said firmly, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. &#34;Dean&#39;s getting desperate, and it&#39;s only a matter of time before he makes a move. You and Merlin need to be somewhere safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta hesitated, glancing toward the living room where Merlin was playing with his toys. &#34;Is it that serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s worse than you think,&#34; I replied, lowering my voice. &#34;Dean knows we&#39;re close to exposing him. I can&#39;t risk him coming after either of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. &#34;Give me a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Benedicta and Merlin were bundled up and ready to leave. I carried Merlin&#39;s bag while Benedicta held his hand tightly, her face etched with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were settled in my car, I drove straight to my house, my mind racing. As soon as we arrived, I ushered them inside and locked the doors behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here,&#34; I instructed, pointing to the living room. &#34;I&#39;ll handle the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta nodded, sitting down with Merlin, who was too distracted by his surroundings to notice the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went straight to my office and pulled up the live feed from the chip I had placed on Dean. The grainy footage showed him walking into what looked like a small, hidden structure. My gut twisted as I watched him retrieve another gun-a different one this time-from a secret compartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair, a slow smile spreading across my face. &#34;Got you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta walked in quietly, her expression curious. &#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed to the screen. &#34;He destroyed the wrong gun. But now we know where he&#39;s keeping the real one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flickered across her face. &#34;So what&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my phone and dialed a number. &#34;We&#39;re going to take it from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call connected, I spoke quickly, giving my men the coordinates of the hideout. &#34;Get there quietly. Take the gun, but make sure no one sees you. I don&#39;t want Dean catching wind of this until it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, I leaned back in my chair, exhaling deeply. The pieces were finally falling into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sat down across from me, a small smile playing on her lips. &#34;You&#39;re really something, Luca. I don&#39;t know how you manage to stay two steps ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked. &#34;It&#39;s not about being ahead. It&#39;s about knowing your opponent. Dean thinks he&#39;s clever, but his arrogance is his biggest weakness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, looking more at ease. &#34;So, what happens now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now,&#34; I said, standing up, &#34;we wait. Once we have the gun, it&#39;s game over for Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked back into the living room, I found Merlin curled up on the couch, fast asleep. Benedicta sat beside him, her expression softening as she stroked his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be safe here,&#34; I assured her. &#34;Dean won&#39;t know what hit him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at me, her eyes filled with gratitude. &#34;Thank you, Luca. For everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my resolve hardening. &#34;I&#39;m not doing this just for Lia or Benedicta. I&#39;m doing this for everyone Dean&#39;s hurt. And when the time comes, he&#39;ll have no one to blame but himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night stretched on, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of satisfaction. The tide was turning, and Dean&#39;s downfall was only a matter of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>163</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of responsibility bore down on me as I walked to my wardrobe and selected a long, formal gown in a deep shade of red. It was the color of power, of justice of finality. Today marked the end for Lia. Today, she would face judgment for her crime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dressed, I tied my hair back in a sleek bun and slipped on a pair of black heels. My reflection in the mirror stared back at me, fierce and composed, but inside, I felt a twinge of uncertainty. Shaking it off, I grabbed my phone and left my chambers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dungeon was damp, the cold air biting against my skin as I walked down the dimly lit corridors. Lia sat in the far corner of her cell, her face pale but defiant. She didn&#39;t look like someone who was about to face her end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up,&#34; I ordered, unlocking the cell door. My voice was clipped and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia stood slowly, her movements deliberate, as if mocking my authority. &#34;So, it&#39;s today,&#34; she said, her voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her tone, grabbing her arm and pulling her out of the cell. &#34;Today marks your final day,&#34; I said coldly. &#34;The day you&#39;ll be judged and punished for killing Finn. And after that, you&#39;ll be gone from this earth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia didn&#39;t respond, but I could feel her gaze burning into my back as I led her through the halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grand hall was already bustling with activity. The elders sat in their designated seats, their faces solemn and expectant. Guards stood at attention along the walls, their eyes trained on me as I pushed Lia forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move,&#34; I snapped, shoving her toward the spot designated for her at the center of the room. Lia stumbled slightly but caught herself, her expression unreadable as she took her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up to my seat at the head of the table and sat down. Taking a deep breath, I addressed the room. &#34;Elders, we may begin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could speak, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I hesitated, glancing down at the screen. It was an anonymous message. A part of me wanted to ignore it-this was no time for distractions but something compelled me to check it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlocking my phone, I opened the message and saw a video file. My pulse quickened as I pressed play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage was shaky but clear. It showed Luca and Dean standing together, talking in hushed tones. I turned up the volume, and their voices filled my ears:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;we destroy this gun, and it&#39;s over,&#34; Luca was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s reply was chillingly calm. &#34;Fine. But I don&#39;t trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, my mind racing. What were they doing together? Why was Dean discussing a gun with Luca?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina?&#34; one of the elders prompted, drawing my attention back to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly locked my phone and forced a neutral expression. &#34;Halt the meeting,&#34; I said abruptly. &#34;I&#39;ve just received an urgent message that requires my attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders exchanged confused glances but complied, leaning back in their chairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they murmured among themselves, I replayed the video, this time plugging in my earphones to hear every word clearly. The conversation between Luca and Dean continued their tone tense but calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit me like a thunderbolt. My thoughts flashed back to what Lia had said during her initial plea: &#34;What if I&#39;m not the one responsible? What if the person is really close to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be true? Could Dean, my trusted partner, have something to do with Finn&#39;s death?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounded in my chest as the implications sank in. I needed time to process this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guards,&#34; I called out, my voice steady but firm. &#34;Take Lia to a spare room and lock her in. She is to remain there until further notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards immediately moved to comply, grabbing Lia and escorting her out of the hall. Lia didn&#39;t resist, but as she passed me, she gave me a small, knowing smile that sent a chill down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, I stood up, my legs feeling unsteady beneath me. &#34;This meeting is adjourned,&#34; I announced, earning confused looks from the elders. &#34;I&#39;ll call for you again when I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, I left the hall and retreated to my office, shutting the door behind me. The walls seemed to close in as I paced the room, the video replaying in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out my phone, I tried to trace the sender of the message, but it was no use. The number was untraceable, and the sender was anonymous. Frustration boiled within me, mixing with the nagging sense of betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t ignore this. I needed answers, and there was only one person who could give them to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I dialed Dean&#39;s number. The phone rang twice before he picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina?&#34; His voice was calm, but I could detect a hint of surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something we need to discuss,&#34; I said, keeping my tone measured. &#34;It&#39;s important. Come to my office immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean hesitated for a moment. &#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I ended the call, I let out a shaky sigh. My hands trembled slightly as I placed the phone on my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever was happening, I needed to get to the bottom of it. And if Dean was hiding something, I would find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tapped my fingers on the table as I stared at my phone, the minutes ticking by agonizingly slow. I hoped Alina had received the anonymous video and would do the right thing to halt the meeting. That single video held the power to turn everything upside down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca was near the meeting area, which was perfect for getting updates. Without wasting time, I dialed her number. She picked up almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; I said quickly. &#34;What&#39;s happening? Has Alina stopped the meeting yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause before Bianca answered. &#34;She stopped it,&#34; she whispered. &#34;Lia&#39;s been taken to another room, and Alina went straight to her office. She looked rattled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied smile tugged at my lips. &#34;Good. That means she saw the video. Keep an eye out for any other developments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will do,&#34; Bianca replied before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, I called Luca. He answered on the second ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She stopped the meeting,&#34; I told him. &#34;Alina&#39;s in her office now. Bianca says she looked shaken, so she must&#39;ve seen the video. I&#39;ll try to find out what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Luca said, his voice steady but tense. &#34;Let me know what you find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up and stood, smoothing down the front of my shirt. It was time to act. I walked confidently down the hall toward Alina&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards stationed outside gave me a brief glance but said nothing as I pushed open the door without knocking. Alina was pacing the room, her arms folded across her chest. She looked up sharply, her face a mix of frustration and unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny,&#34; she said flatly, stopping mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feigned concern, stepping inside and closing the door behind me. &#34;I heard the meeting was stopped. I thought Lia would&#39;ve been punished by now. Honestly, I was hoping to see that happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s expression darkened, and she let out a sharp breath. &#34;I halted the meeting,&#34; she said curtly, &#34;and I&#39;m waiting for Dean to arrive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly masked my surprise. &#34;Dean? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina didn&#39;t answer. Instead, she turned away, her gaze fixed on the window as though lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed her again. &#34;Alina, what&#39;s going on? Why would you stop the meeting for Dean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she said nothing, her silence only deepening my curiosity. Whatever was on her mind, it was clearly serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided not to push further. &#34;Well,&#34; I said, injecting a hint of false cheer into my tone, &#34;I hope everything works out. But for what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;d really love to see Lia punished. She deserves it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina didn&#39;t respond, and I took that as my cue to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I was out of her office, a triumphant smile spread across my face. I headed straight to Bianca, who was waiting for me in the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; Bianca asked, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in close, lowering my voice. &#34;It&#39;s working,&#34; I said, my excitement barely contained. &#34;She stopped the meeting, and she&#39;s waiting for Dean. She didn&#39;t say why, but you could see the doubt all over her face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s grin mirrored mine. &#34;Finally. She&#39;s starting to see the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; I said, crossing my arms. &#34;And once she confronts Dean, it&#39;ll all come crashing down for him. He&#39;s been walking around like he&#39;s untouchable, but not anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nodded eagerly. &#34;Do you think she&#39;ll punish him immediately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She might,&#34; I said with a smirk. &#34;But even if she doesn&#39;t, she&#39;s already questioning him. That&#39;s all we need for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back, savoring the moment. Everything was falling into place. Dean thought he could outsmart everyone, but his arrogance would be his downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to stay close,&#34; I added, my tone serious now. &#34;The moment Alina makes a move, we need to be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca nodded again, her expression determined. &#34;This is just the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, satisfied. Dean wouldn&#39;t see it coming. And when the truth was finally out, he&#39;d have no one to blame but himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>164</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of tires crunching gravel outside brought a wave of relief over me. My guys were back, and I had no doubt they&#39;d completed the task. I walked to the window, watching as they stepped out of the van, one of them holding a small, padded case. A sense of accomplishment filled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door before they even knocked, motioning for them to come in. The leader of the group, Matteo, handed me the case. &#34;It&#39;s done,&#34; he said simply, his tone firm but respectful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I replied, opening the case to inspect the contents. There it was-the gun Dean had so desperately tried to keep hidden. Its weight in my hand felt like the weight of victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matteo leaned closer. &#34;What&#39;s next, boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed the gun carefully on the table and turned to face him and the others. &#34;Now we wait. Dean doesn&#39;t know we&#39;ve got the real weapon. For now, I want you all to lay low. No sudden movements. If Dean catches even a whiff of what we&#39;re up to, he&#39;ll disappear, and we can&#39;t afford that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They nodded in unison, and I dismissed them. Alone again, I picked up my phone and dialed Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered on the first ring. &#34;Luca, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s done,&#34; I said, pacing the room. &#34;We&#39;ve got the gun. Now I need you to focus on Dean. Keep an eye on him, follow his movements, and report everything back to me. He&#39;s bound to slip up now that we&#39;ve rattled him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider it done,&#34; Jenny said confidently. &#34;But there&#39;s something else. I&#39;ve found out where they&#39;re keeping Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That got my full attention. I stopped pacing, gripping the phone tightly. &#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s locked in a spare room in the west wing,&#34; Jenny said. &#34;Alina had her moved there after she saw the video. She&#39;s stalling for now, but it won&#39;t be long before Dean gets involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a slow breath, processing the information. &#34;Good work. Keep your distance for now, but don&#39;t let her out of your sight. I&#39;ll handle the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny hesitated for a moment. &#34;Do you really think we can get her out before Dean makes his next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have a choice,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;Lia has been vindicated. She doesn&#39;t deserve to stay locked up another minute. Dean&#39;s days of manipulating everyone around him are over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny agreed and hung up. I stood there for a moment, formulating the next steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed a notepad and began sketching out a rough plan. Getting Lia out wouldn&#39;t be easy. The west wing was heavily guarded, and with tensions running high, any misstep could result in disaster. I needed to be smart, to anticipate every possible obstacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first step was to secure a distraction. If Dean or Alina were occupied elsewhere, it would give me the window I needed. I jotted down a few ideas, knowing I&#39;d need Jenny and Bianca&#39;s help to pull it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second step was the extraction itself. Lia was likely under lock and key, so I&#39;d need someone on the inside to disable the security system. Matteo&#39;s team could handle that. They&#39;d proven themselves capable tonight, and I trusted them to get the job done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, there was the escape route. Once Lia was out, I couldn&#39;t bring her back here-it would be the first place Dean would look. I&#39;d already scouted a safe house outside the city, hidden and secure. It would be the perfect place to lay low until the dust settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the plan started coming together, a sense of determination took hold. Lia had suffered enough. She&#39;d been dragged through the mud, accused of a crime she didn&#39;t commit, all because of Dean&#39;s lies. Now that I had the evidence to expose him, it was time to put an end to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the gun from the table, studying it closely. This small piece of metal held the power to change everything. With it, I could not only prove Lia&#39;s innocence but also take Dean down once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed with a message from Jenny: Dean just arrived at Alina&#39;s office. Looks tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled to myself. Let them talk. Let them dig their own graves. Meanwhile, I&#39;d be working in the shadows, putting the final pieces of the puzzle together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called Matteo again. &#34;We&#39;ve got another mission,&#34; I said. &#34;Get the team ready. This one&#39;s delicate, but it&#39;s the most important one yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, boss,&#34; he replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call and leaned back in my chair, my mind racing. Tomorrow, we&#39;d set the plan in motion. Lia would finally be free, and Dean would face the consequences of his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a long while, I felt like we were one step ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Dean walked into my office, I couldn&#39;t keep the anger from boiling over. I stood from my chair, glaring at him as he casually shut the door behind him. &#34;Where the hell have you been?&#34; I demanded, my voice sharper than intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his hands in mock surrender, his face an unreadable mask. &#34;I&#39;ve been handling a few things. What&#39;s the problem now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Handling things?&#34; I scoffed. &#34;What exactly were you handling, Dean? Because I&#39;ve been getting some very interesting messages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression faltered, a flicker of unease crossing his features. Before he could utter a word, I picked up my phone and shoved it in his face, showing him the video of him and Luca together. His jaw tightened, and for a moment, I thought he might deny everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Explain this!&#34; I yelled, throwing the phone onto the desk in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean hesitated, his gaze shifting between me and the video. &#34;It&#39;s not what it looks like,&#34; he said finally, his voice calm but calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not what it looks like?&#34; I repeated, my fury mounting. &#34;You&#39;re meeting with Luca, Dean! The same man who&#39;s been working against us! What are you hiding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, my phone buzzed again. I glanced at the screen and froze. Another video had come in this time, with audio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced as I clicked play. Dean moved closer, trying to get a look, but I turned away, refusing to let him touch the phone. I plugged in my earphones, pressing them in tightly, and the office fell silent save for the sound of the video playing in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I listened, my blood ran cold. The voices were unmistakable-Dean and Luca, discussing Merlin, Lia, and the gun. Every word they exchanged unraveled another thread of the lies I&#39;d been fed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked the earphones out and played the video aloud, my hand trembling as I held up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s face went pale. &#34;Alina, listen-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare!&#34; I snapped, stepping back as the realization hit me like a freight train. &#34;You lied to me! You&#39;ve been lying to me this entire time! Everything Lia said-it was true, wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand twitched, and before I could react, he pulled a silver blade from his pocket, pointing it at me with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stumbled back, the shock paralyzing me. &#34;Dean...what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit down, Alina,&#34; he commanded, his voice icy and devoid of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really like this?&#34; I whispered, my voice barely audible as I pieced it all together. The manipulation, the deceit, the lengths he&#39;d gone to protect himself-it all made sense now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit down,&#34; he repeated, this time with more force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other choice, I sank into the chair, my mind racing. He approached me slowly, pulling a length of rope from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean, please, we can talk about this,&#34; I pleaded, trying to buy time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to talk about,&#34; he said coldly, tying my hands firmly behind the chair. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t have gotten involved, Alina. You should&#39;ve just trusted me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trusted you?&#34; I hissed, my anger reigniting despite my fear. &#34;After everything you&#39;ve done? You&#39;re a monster!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finished tying the rope and leaned down, his face inches from mine. &#34;You think I&#39;m the monster?&#34; he said with a bitter laugh. &#34;You have no idea what I&#39;ve been through to get here. But don&#39;t worry-you&#39;ll understand soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened and walked to the door, pausing with his hand on the knob. &#34;Don&#39;t scream,&#34; he warned, glancing back at me. &#34;It won&#39;t help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he slipped out of the office, leaving me bound and seething. As the door clicked shut, I let out a shaky breath, the weight of the situation crashing down on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean was a liar, a manipulator, and now a threat to everyone around him. For the first time, I realized just how deep h</p>
                
                
                
                <p>is betrayal ran and how far he was willing to go to protect himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this wasn&#39;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>165</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and I stood just outside Alina&#39;s office door, our ears straining for any hint of what was happening inside. The confrontation we&#39;d witnessed through the small crack in the door had left us both on edge. Dean had tied Alina up and left her helpless, and now we were ready to stop him before he could cause more harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door suddenly swung open, and Dean emerged, his expression a mix of panic and determination. He froze for a split second upon seeing us, then scowled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you off to in such a rush?&#34; I asked, stepping into his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca crossed her arms, blocking his escape in the other direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out of my way,&#34; Dean growled, his voice low and threatening. &#34;I don&#39;t have time for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny,&#34; Bianca said, her tone sharp. &#34;You didn&#39;t seem to have time for anything else when you were tying up Alina a few minutes ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s face darkened, and he took a step forward, clearly ready to force his way through. But before he could make a move, the pack sentinels appeared, emerging from the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; one of them said, his tone commanding, &#34;you&#39;re not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes darted around, his jaw clenching as he realized he was cornered. &#34;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing,&#34; he snapped, trying to push past the nearest sentinel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sentinel grabbed his arm and yanked him back, pinning him against the wall. Another joined in, ensuring he couldn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a mistake!&#34; Dean shouted, struggling against their grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save it,&#34; I said, stepping closer to him. &#34;We&#39;ve seen enough to know exactly who you are. You&#39;re done, Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried into Alina&#39;s office, my heart pounding as I spotted her tied to the chair. Her face was pale, her expression a mix of anger and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina!&#34; I rushed over, quickly untying the ropes around her wrists. She winced as I freed her, rubbing her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said breathlessly, standing on shaky legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca entered the room, glancing over her shoulder. &#34;The sentinels have him secured. What should we do next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina straightened, her determination shining through the anger in her eyes. &#34;We take him to the dungeon. He doesn&#39;t deserve to be anywhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the three of us made our way to the dungeon, where the sentinels had already dragged Dean. He was inside a cold, dark cell, pacing like a caged animal. When he saw us, his eyes narrowed, and he slammed a fist against the bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing!&#34; he snarled. &#34;This isn&#39;t over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s over,&#34; Alina said, her voice icy. &#34;Your judgment is coming very soon, and you&#39;ll pay for everything you&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean laughed bitterly. &#34;You think you can stop me? You think you&#39;re in control? You have no idea what&#39;s coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save your threats,&#34; Bianca snapped, her tone matching Alina&#39;s. &#34;No one&#39;s afraid of you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my phone and quickly called Luca. The line barely rang before he picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Luca asked, his voice tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s done,&#34; I told him. &#34;Dean&#39;s in the dungeon. He&#39;s been exposed, and Alina&#39;s safe. But you need to get here. Things are escalating fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m on my way,&#34; Luca said. &#34;Keep an eye on him. Don&#39;t let him out of your sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call and turned back to the cell. Dean was sitting on the bench inside, his hands clasped as he glared at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca&#39;s coming,&#34; I informed Alina. &#34;We&#39;ll get to the bottom of this soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina nodded, though her gaze remained fixed on Dean. &#34;He won&#39;t get away with this,&#34; she said firmly. &#34;Not this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca placed a hand on her shoulder, offering silent support. I knew this was far from over, but for now, we had the upper hand. Dean&#39;s reign of deceit and manipulation was crumbling, and soon, justice would be served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the corner of the cold, damp dungeon, my back pressed against the rough stone wall. My wrists ached from the heavy chains, but the pain in my heart was far worse. I had been accused of something I hadn&#39;t done, and no matter how hard I tried to convince them, no one believed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open suddenly, and I flinched at the sound of approaching footsteps. The light from the hallway spilled into the dark room, and I squinted, trying to make out who it was. My breath hitched when I saw Alina, followed closely by Jenny and Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrambled to my feet, unsure of what to expect. Were they here to finally pass judgment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; Alina&#39;s voice broke through the silence, softer than I&#39;d ever heard it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; I asked warily, my voice hoarse from lack of use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and Bianca stepped forward, unlocking the chains around my wrists. The weight fell away, and I rubbed the sore spots, still watching them with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here to take you out of this place,&#34; Bianca said, her tone gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked in disbelief. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve exposed Dean,&#34; Jenny explained, her eyes meeting mine. &#34;Alina knows the truth now. Dean&#39;s been manipulating everything from the start. He&#39;s in the dungeon now, waiting for judgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words took a moment to sink in. I stared at them, searching for any sign of deceit, but all I saw was sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this real?&#34; I whispered, my voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina stepped closer, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. &#34;Lia, I owe you an apology. A deep, heartfelt apology. I should have believed you. I should have listened to you instead of letting my anger cloud my judgment. I&#39;m so sorry for everything I put you through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit me like a tidal wave, and for a moment, I couldn&#39;t speak. The weight of her apology, combined with the revelation that my nightmare was finally over, overwhelmed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and Bianca looked at me with matching expressions of remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re sorry too,&#34; Jenny said softly. &#34;We should have done more. We should have questioned things. Please forgive us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt tears welling up in my eyes, and before I could stop myself, I was nodding. &#34;I I forgive you,&#34; I managed to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina stepped forward and wrapped her arms around me. For a moment, I froze, unsure of how to react. But then the warmth of her embrace melted my hesitation, and I hugged her back tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and Bianca joined in, and the four of us stood there in a circle, united in a way I hadn&#39;t thought possible just hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as we stepped back, the sound of footsteps echoed from the hallway. We all turned to see Luca walking in, his expression a mixture of relief and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I breathed, my heart skipping a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode toward us, his gaze locked on mine. Alina glanced at Jenny and Bianca, and without a word, they nodded and began to walk out of the dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll give you two some privacy,&#34; Alina said softly before disappearing through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed felt heavy but not uncomfortable. Luca came closer, and I could see the worry etched into his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry for everything,&#34; he said, his voice low. &#34;I should have done more to protect you. I should have been there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, tears streaming down my face. &#34;You did what you could. You believed me when no one else did. That&#39;s all that matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out and cupped my face, his thumb brushing away a tear. &#34;I promise you, Lia, no one will ever hurt you again. Not Dean, not anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in what felt like forever, I allowed myself to feel a glimmer of hope. Luca had always been my anchor, and now, with Dean&#39;s lies unraveling, I felt like I could finally breathe again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I whispered, leaning into his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s lips curved into a small smile. &#34;You don&#39;t need to thank me. You deserve justice, and I&#39;ll make sure you get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stood there in silence for a while, the tension and fear of the past few weeks slowly melting away. For the first time, I felt safe. I felt like I wasn&#39;t alo</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not in this fight anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as I looked into Luca&#39;s eyes, I knew that no matter what happened next, we&#39;d face it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>166</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall was silent, the air heavy with tension as I sat at the head of the long table, my eyes locked on Dean. He stood before us, restrained by the pack sentinels, his once-confident demeanor reduced to a pale, trembling shadow of the man he used to be. He had no more lies to spin, no more manipulations to hide behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders murmured amongst themselves, their voices a low hum in the background. I kept my gaze fixed on Dean, my emotions a whirlwind of anger, regret, and determination. This was justice-not just for Finn, but for Lia, for the pack, and for myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; I began, my voice steady and commanding, &#34;your actions have brought nothing but pain and destruction to this pack. You murdered Finn, framed Lia, and deceived me at every turn. Your betrayal runs deep, and for that, you must face the consequences of your actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth, perhaps to beg for mercy or spin another excuse, but I raised a hand to silence him. I couldn&#39;t hear another word from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The council has deliberated,&#34; I continued, &#34;and the sentence is death by hanging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps filled the room, but I remained unmoved. This wasn&#39;t a decision I made lightly, but it was necessary. Dean had not only betrayed me but also threatened the very fabric of our pack. He couldn&#39;t be allowed to harm anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s face crumbled, and for a brief moment, I saw the man I once trusted, the man who had been part of my inner circle. But that man was gone, replaced by a monster who had betrayed us all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sentinels dragged him out of the hall, his protests echoing faintly down the corridor. I took a deep breath, steadying myself as I turned to the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Dean&#39;s judgment passed, it&#39;s time for us to heal,&#34; I said, my voice soft but resolute. &#34;And I believe the best way to do that is by placing the clan in the hands of someone who has proven their strength, loyalty, and resilience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs started again, this time filled with curiosity and surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m stepping down as Alpha,&#34; I announced, feeling the weight of my words. &#34;Lia will take my place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia, standing in the back of the room, froze in shock. Her eyes widened as she processed my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve shown incredible courage, Lia,&#34; I continued, looking directly at her. &#34;You&#39;ve endured more than anyone should, and you&#39;ve come out stronger. The pack needs someone like you-someone with a heart that can lead them into a better future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Alina,&#34; she started, her voice shaky, &#34;you&#39;re the Alpha. This is your pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, a bittersweet feeling settling in my chest. &#34;It&#39;s time for me to find my own path, Lia. I&#39;ve been the Alpha for years, and I&#39;ve lost myself along the way. I need to step back, to rediscover who I am. The pack will be in good hands with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted into applause, and I saw Lia&#39;s hesitant smile turn into one of pride and acceptance. I knew she would do great things, and Luca would be there to support her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engagement party was a vibrant celebration, the hall decorated with lights and flowers as the pack gathered to honor Lia and Luca&#39;s union. I watched from the sidelines, a sense of peace washing over me. Lia and Luca deserved this moment of happiness after everything they&#39;d been through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night wore on, Jenny and Bianca found me sitting by myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really going through with this?&#34; Bianca asked her tone a mix of sadness and understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;It&#39;s time for me to go. I need to figure out who I am without the weight of the Alpha title.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny placed a hand on my shoulder. &#34;We&#39;re going to miss you, Alina. But we understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Jenny and Bianca accompanied me to the airport. The three of us stood near the gate, a mix of emotions swirling between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sure about this?&#34; Bianca asked, her voice soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded a small smile on my lips. &#34;It&#39;s not goodbye forever. Just for now. Lia and Luca will lead the pack well. It&#39;s their time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny hugged me tightly, her voice breaking as she said, &#34;Take care of yourself, Alina. And don&#39;t forget to call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed lightly, the sound bittersweet. &#34;I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the final boarding call echoed through the terminal, I turned to them one last time. &#34;Thank you for everything. I&#39;ll see you again, someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one last wave, I walked toward the gate, my heart heavy but hopeful. For the first time in years, I was free to explore who I was, to find peace beyond the pack. And as I stepped onto the plane, I knew I was leaving them in capable hands. Lia would lead them into a brighter future, and I would finally be able to carve out a new path for myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening sunlight filtered through the wide windows of the dining hall, casting a golden glow over the room. I stood by the table, arranging the final touches for dinner. A nervous excitement buzzed through me as I awaited Benedicta and Merlin&#39;s arrival. It wasn&#39;t every day I hosted someone who had played such a pivotal role in Luca&#39;s life-and now, indirectly, in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts. I wiped my hands on a towel and hurried to answer. Standing there were Benedicta and Merlin, smiles lighting their faces. Merlin clung to Benedicta&#39;s hand, his innocent gaze wandering curiously around the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; Benedicta greeted warmly, leaning in for a hug. &#34;Thank you for inviting us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I replied, my voice genuine. &#34;It&#39;s about time we all sat down for a meal together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched down to Merlin&#39;s level, offering him a warm smile. &#34;Hi, Merlin. It&#39;s so nice to finally meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled shyly, hiding partially behind Benedicta. &#34;Hi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca appeared behind me, his presence a steadying comfort. &#34;Come in, both of you. Dinner&#39;s ready, and Lia&#39;s been working hard to make it perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dining table was set with dishes ranging from roasted vegetables to Luca&#39;s favorite lamb stew. Conversation flowed easily, with Benedicta sharing stories about Merlin&#39;s mischievous antics and Luca recounting some of his childhood memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin had warmed up quickly, his laughter filling the room as Luca playfully teased him about finishing his greens. I watched them interact, my heart swelling with affection. Seeing Luca like this-kind, attentive, and playful-was a side of him I cherished deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, we moved to the living room, where Merlin busied himself with a puzzle Benedicta had brought along. Benedicta leaned back in her chair, her gaze warm and thoughtful as she looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; she began, her tone sincere, &#34;thank you for opening your home to us. Merlin has been through so much, and I can already see how much he feels at ease here. I know you&#39;ll make an amazing stepmother to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caught me off guard, and a lump formed in my throat. I glanced at Merlin, who was focused on his puzzle, and then at Luca, who gave me an encouraging smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my pleasure,&#34; I said softly, my voice thick with emotion. &#34;He&#39;s a wonderful boy, and I&#39;m happy to have him here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta smiled, placing a gentle hand on mine. &#34;I&#39;ll be heading back soon, but Merlin will stay with you. I trust you and Luca to take care of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were a gift, one that carried the weight of trust and responsibility. I nodded, grateful for the chance to be a part of Merlin&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, as Benedicta prepared to leave, Luca stood beside her at the door. I was helping Merlin settle into the guest room when I overheard their conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta,&#34; Luca said, his tone tinged with excitement, &#34;I wanted to tell you something. Lia and I are getting married in two weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze for a moment, my heart skipping a beat. I knew the wedding was imminent, but hearing it spoken out loud made it feel so much more real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s delighted laugh followed. &#34;That&#39;s wonderful news, Luca! I couldn&#39;t be happier for both of you. Merlin will be thrilled, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to the living room, Benedicta hugged me tightly, her eyes shining with happiness. &#34;Congratulations, Lia. I can&#39;t wait to see you as a bride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I whispered, overwhelmed by her warmth and sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Benedicta left, Luca found me standing by the window, gazing out into the night. He wrapped his arms around me, resting his chin on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay?&#34; he asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, leaning into his embrace. &#34;Just thinking about everything. It feels like life is finally falling into place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a kiss to my temple. &#34;It is. And I can&#39;t wait to spend the rest of it with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days that followed were filled with preparations for the wedding. Merlin settled into his new routine quickly, his laughter bringing life to the house. Luca and I worked together to create a home that felt warm and welcoming, not just for ourselves but for Merlin, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every now and then, I&#39;d catch Merlin humming to himself as he played, his face lit with a smile that made my heart swell. It was in those moments I realized just how much our lives were intertwining, becoming a family in every sense of the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the wedding drew closer, the anticipation grew, not just for the ceremony but for the life we were building together. And for the first time in a long time, I felt at peace, surrounded by love, trust, and the promise of a brighter future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>167</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day had finally arrived. The day I had waited for, dreamed of and worked tirelessly to see come to fruition. My wedding day. As I stood at the altar in the grand cathedral, sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting a kaleidoscope of colors onto the marble floor. The air was heavy with the scent of roses and lavender, a symbol of unity for our clans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests from both sides filled the pews, their once-hostile gazes now softened by the promise of peace. Today wasn&#39;t just about Lia and me-it was about forging a bond that would unite two warring clans into one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, the doors opened, and there she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia. My bride. My queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked down the aisle with a grace that stole my breath. Her gown was exquisite, flowing like liquid light, and her eyes were locked on mine. At that moment, the world narrowed to just the two of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached me, I took her hands in mine, unable to suppress the smile tugging at my lips. &#34;You&#39;re breathtaking,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re mine,&#34; she replied, her voice steady despite the emotion glistening in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceremony passed in a blur of vows, rings, and applause. When the officiant pronounced us husband and wife, I didn&#39;t hesitate. I pulled Lia into my arms and kissed her deeply, sealing our union amidst the cheers of our clans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The After Party</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reception was a grand affair, held in the sprawling gardens of my family estate. The moon hung high, casting a silver glow over the festivities. Guests mingled, laughter and music filling the air as the two clans celebrated together for the first time in history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our first dance as husband and wife was nothing short of magical. The band played a soft melody, and Lia melted into my arms as we swayed under the stars. Her laughter was contagious, her joy radiating to everyone around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night went on, alliances were formed over shared toasts, and old grievances were set aside. The once-impossible dream of unity was now a reality, and it was all because of Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin, ever the charmer, stole Lia away for a dance, and I watched with a smile as she twirled the little boy around. He had come to mean so much to both of us, a symbol of the family we were building together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love Making</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the festivities wound down, Lia and I retreated to our private suite. The moment the door closed, the air shifted, charged with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to me, her eyes dark with desire. &#34;Finally,&#34; she murmured, her voice low and teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed the distance between us, my hands finding her waist as I pulled her close. Her lips met mine in a kiss that was both tender and hungry, a mix of love and passion that left me breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any idea how much I love you?&#34; I whispered against her lips, my hands trailing down to the delicate buttons of her gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me,&#34; she replied, her voice trembling with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I undressed her slowly, savoring every moment as her gown pooled at her feet. She was stunning, her beauty illuminated by the soft glow of candlelight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re perfect,&#34; I said, my voice filled with reverence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re overdressed,&#34; she teased, her fingers working to remove my jacket and shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we were finally bare before each other, I guided her to the bed, our connection deepening with every touch and kiss. Our bodies moved together, a symphony of love and need, every sigh and whispered promise binding us closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we reached the peak of our passion, I held her tightly, overwhelmed by the depth of my feelings. Lia was my everything-my partner, my queen, my forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joining Both Clans Together</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning after our wedding, we stood before the leaders of both clans, the weight of history pressing down on us. Lia stood beside me, her presence commanding yet warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time to move forward,&#34; I began, my voice steady. &#34;For too long, our clans have been divided by conflict. Today, we stand united-not just by marriage, but by a shared vision for the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia stepped forward, her voice strong. &#34;This isn&#39;t just about Luca and me. It&#39;s about all of us. Together, we can build a legacy of peace, strength, and prosperity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Applause erupted, the sound echoing through the hall as one by one, the leaders came forward to pledge their support for the alliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, as Lia and I walked through the gardens, hand in hand, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of accomplishment. We had done the impossible-united two clans and created a foundation for a better future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, as we lay together, I held her close, my heart full of gratitude and love. &#34;We did it,&#34; I whispered, pressing a kiss to her temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, her fingers tracing patterns on my chest. &#34;No, Luca. This is just the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was right. Together, there was nothing we couldn&#39;t achieve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plane hummed softly beneath us as Merlin sat between Luca and me, his excitement infectious. He kept pointing out the window, marveling at the clouds and the world below. Luca leaned in, answering every question with patience and amusement, his deep voice warm and soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but smile at the sight of them together. Merlin had brought so much light into our lives, and this vacation was a chance to bond as a family before the whirlwind of duties claimed us again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and Bianca had insisted we take this trip. &#34;You two need it,&#34; Bianca had said, her hand resting comfortably on her boyfriend&#39;s shoulder. The deputy of the police department, Zachary, had been nothing but supportive, a rock for Bianca as she navigated her new leadership role. Seeing her happy was a relief-she deserved this after everything we&#39;d been through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny, on the other hand, had rolled her eyes. &#34;Go on, Lia. Leave everything to us. Bianca&#39;s busy with her deputy, but I&#39;ll keep the clan running. Maybe I&#39;ll even find some excitement while you&#39;re away. Who knows, I might even find love.&#34; She laughed, but there was a hint of longing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will,&#34; I&#39;d told her, hugging her tightly before we left. &#34;If anyone deserves it, it&#39;s you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our destination was a secluded island resort, chosen for its privacy and beauty. The moment we arrived, I felt the tension of the past few weeks melt away. The white sand stretched out before us, meeting crystal-clear water that sparkled under the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin immediately ran toward the waves, laughing as the water lapped at his feet. Luca and I followed hand in hand, the breeze tugging at our hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was a good idea,&#34; Luca murmured, his voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned into him, letting the warmth of his presence envelop me. &#34;It was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We spent the next few days exploring the island, indulging in its beauty and tranquility. Merlin&#39;s laughter echoed as we built sandcastles, chased crabs, and swam in the calm waters. At night, we sat around a small bonfire, sharing stories and basking in the glow of family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was during one of these quiet evenings that I began to suspect something. I&#39;d felt a strange fluttering in my stomach earlier that day, and a wave of dizziness had hit me out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca noticed immediately. &#34;Are you okay?&#34; he asked, his brow furrowed with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved it off with a laugh. &#34;Probably just too much sun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the days passed, the symptoms became more pronounced-fatigue, nausea, and a craving for citrus that had me stealing every orange on the island. It wasn&#39;t long before the realization hit me like a wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent a rush of joy through me. Merlin would have a sibling. Luca and I would have another child to love, to cherish, to call our own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited until we were alone to tell Luca. We were walking along the shore at sunset, the sky painted in hues of orange and pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I began, stopping to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to me, his expression soft and attentive. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took his hands, placing them gently on my stomach. &#34;We&#39;re having a baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he just stared at me, his eyes wide with disbelief. Then, his face broke into the most radiant smile I&#39;d ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A baby?&#34; he repeated, his voice filled with wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, tears springing to my eyes as he pulled me into his arms. &#34;A baby,&#34; I confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a kiss to my forehead, his hands never leaving my stomach. &#34;You&#39;ve made me the happiest man alive, Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stood there for a long time, the waves lapping at our feet, the stars beginning to twinkle above us. It was a moment I would treasure forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, we told Merlin. His reaction was priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to be a big brother?&#34; he asked, his eyes wide with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you are,&#34; I said, laughing as he danced around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can it be a little brother?&#34; he asked, tilting his head in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll see,&#34; Luca said, ruffling his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin beamed. &#34;I&#39;ll teach him everything I know!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As our vacation came to an end, I found myself feeling both excited and at peace. Our family was growing, and our future was brighter than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before we left the island, I sent a message to Jenny and Bianca, letting them know the good news. Bianca responded with a string of exclamation points, while Jenny replied with a simple, &#34;Told you everything would work out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, there would be challenges, responsibilities, and the ever-present weight of leadership. But for now, I was content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had Luca. I had Merlin. And soon, I would have another little one to hold in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>168</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Epilogue</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The early morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the room. The gentle hum of the ocean waves outside was a constant reminder of how much life had changed over the past five years. I stretched lazily in bed, glancing over to see Luca already awake, leaning against the headboard with a book in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re up early,&#34; I murmured, snuggling closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at me, his lips curling into a smile. &#34;Couldn&#39;t sleep. Thought I&#39;d make the most of the quiet before the chaos begins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed softly. Chaos was an understatement when it came to our house these days. With two young boys and a girl who had inherited her father&#39;s stubbornness, mornings were anything but quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I predicted, the door burst open, and Merlin ran in, followed closely by his siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! Dad! You promised we&#39;d go riding today!&#34; Merlin, now ten, was the leader of their little trio, his energy boundless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you promised!&#34; echoed four-year-old Finn, his bright eyes shining with excitement. He was the spitting image of Luca, right down to the serious furrow of his brows when he tried to act grown-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three-year-old Alina toddled in last, her curls bouncing with every step. She climbed onto the bed and threw her arms around my neck. &#34;Ride horsies!&#34; she demanded with a giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca and I exchanged amused glances. &#34;Alright, alright,&#34; I said, pulling Alina onto my lap. &#34;Go get ready, and we&#39;ll meet you outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids cheered and ran off, leaving the door wide open behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we made our way to the stables, I took a moment to marvel at how far we&#39;d come. The clans were no longer two separate entities but one strong, united family. Luca and I had worked tirelessly to ensure peace and prosperity for everyone. It hadn&#39;t been easy, but seeing the smiles on our children&#39;s faces made it all worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and Jenny had been instrumental in helping us maintain order. Bianca was now happily married to Zachary, the deputy who had won her heart all those years ago. They had two children of their own, and I couldn&#39;t have been prouder of the woman Bianca had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny, true to her word, had found love in the most unexpected place-with a quiet, reserved healer from the clan. They were engaged now, and the sparkle in her eyes every time she spoke about him was proof enough of her happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years ago, we packed our bags and traveled back to the main packhouse for a momentous occasion-Alina&#39;s wedding. I remember how vibrant and joyous the ceremony was, a perfect blend of traditions and personal touches that reflected her fiery personality. The entire clan came together to celebrate, and it was a sight to behold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina, Finn&#39;s sister, had always been a strong and independent soul, but on her wedding day, she was a vision of grace and beauty. She married Damon, a respected warrior from a neighboring pack, and their union not only strengthened alliances but also brought happiness to everyone who knew them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Luca and me, the journey back to the packhouse was bittersweet. It brought back memories of Finn and everything we had endured to get to where we were. Yet, seeing Alina so happy reminded us of the resilience of family and the importance of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our children were just toddlers then, full of energy and curiosity. Merlin was seven, Finn was four, and our youngest, little Alina, was barely two but already showing signs of inheriting her father&#39;s stubbornness. They were the darlings of the wedding, stealing the spotlight with their antics and laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina had always been fond of our children, and that day was no exception. She spent hours playing with them, twirling little Alina around in her arms and letting the boys chase her through the gardens. She doted on them endlessly, and they adored her in return. Even now, when we visit her and Damon, her eyes light up at the sight of our kids. She spoils them with treats and stories, always making them feel like the most important people in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding itself was magical. The ceremony took place under the moonlight, a nod to our werewolf traditions. Alina and Damon exchanged vows surrounded by family, friends, and pack members, their love for each other evident in every word and glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca and I stood among the crowd, hand in hand, watching as the couple pledged their lives to each other. It reminded me of our own journey and how love had grown between us despite the challenges we faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The celebration that followed was unforgettable. The feast was lavish, the music lively, and the dance floor packed. Luca and I took turns chasing after the kids, who were determined to be part of every activity. Merlin insisted on dancing with the bride, while Finn tried his best to keep up with the older kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back, that day marked a new</p>
