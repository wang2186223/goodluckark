                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting me fall to the deep slumber, when I woke up. I was back into the succession ceremony. I glance up and saw a woman heading my way, she was wearing the same white satin lace gown that I saw before. But this time her face was not blurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me with her red and golden eyes, hair as white as the moonlight. Silver-white hair to be exact. Her pale skin was gleaming, as she walks with grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had the same face as her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was staring at me with her cold blank eyes. It was her all this time she was the one who manipulated and deceiving me to betray my whole pack. And the reason why she keep appearing in my head again was because I was still under her control. It does make sense after everything I felt when I saw her. Like I was completely smitten into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but feel angry, I felt betrayed and used. And right now I even help her to hide. Just what on earth was I thinking. If the whole pack knew about this I am sure that I would end up getting more hatred than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the fact that an Alpha is weak without its pack, so I would really need to retrieve my pack and having her here means I would put my whole pack in danger again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes, and she was staring right in my face. In shock I almost fall off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are finally awake.&#34; She uttered, just being near her was making me forget all the thoughts I had before. Her presence was too much for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you just going to keep staring at me?&#34; I didn&#39;t even notice that I was staring for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look away, avoiding her gaze. To be honest I wasn&#39;t even sure what should I do now. I could go and lock her up like the plan but on the other hand I need her to find the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what you are thinking, and I am telling you that it won&#39;t work. And I have no plan on going anywhere.&#34; She mumbled, how could she know what I&#39;m thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was written all over your face. And I could go and read your mind but I&#39;d rather not. I wasn&#39;t interested with what you are thinking anyway.&#34; She added, just who is this person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sure that she was a human but after seeing what she did during the succession. I was starting to doubt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could believe me or not but like I said, I don&#39;t plan on going anywhere and right now I need to get Clint out of here before they could do anything to him.&#34; She mumbled, I couldn&#39;t help but feel angry at her. How could she act like she didn&#39;t do anything wrong right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories started flashing in my head again this time, I was in the Island and all I could see was dead bodies of our pack members. I watch as she tear them to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before I know it I was already gripping her neck, she stared at me like she wasn&#39;t surprised about my action. And what&#39;s even worst is that she even smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why I felt a hint of pain in her smile, when I release her she started coughing while holding her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could kill me some other time but right now I need to do something.&#34; And with that she vanished, leaving the bracelet I put on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she? I run towards the veranda and there she was walking outside. She glance my way waving before she vanished again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like before I let myself be played by her all over again. Clenching my fish I jump off the railings and start heading to where she was originally planning to go. But before I got there Clint was already gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this her plan all along? To keep me busy while Clint was already escaping?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I brush my hair out of frustration. The facility was already burnt when I got there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered the office my father doesn&#39;t look pleased at me. I think he already knew what I just did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where have you been? Did you know that the pack was attacked last night and you were no where to be found! They burnt the facility! And the prisoner escaped!&#34; That, I am fully aware of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what happened to me last night, all I could remember is that I fell into a deep sleep.&#34; I wasn&#39;t lying on that part at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like you are also affected by their doings.&#34; He mumbled, then he explained to me everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All our pack members in charge of the facility was now all dead, no one survived after the attack. And what they said was they heard a loud growl that they never heard before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to do something about this Dwayne, you are the new Alpha now.&#34; Hunter entered the office and threw his gloves on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could they do this to me! Everything I work for is now all in vain!&#34; I wasn&#39;t sure what he was talking about but I think it was connected to the facility which is now completely destroyed.&#34; My mother was following from his behind, and she also doesn&#39;t look pleased about everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could they enter without being notice?!&#34; She uttered, I wasn&#39;t sure what to say to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this also her doings? But last night when I got in the facility the pack members are just sleeping. And she didn&#39;t harm anyone at all. Not even me when she had the full capacity of killing me last night instead she actually did help me. But I also couldn&#39;t hide the fact that she could do that. After everything she have done in the Island this matter is easy for her. Just thinking about her was making my head hurts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne are you listening?&#34; I glance at the three of them and they all didn&#39;t look happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what is the plan now?&#34; I ask, but I know exactly what is running in their mind right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to track them down this time the Faction will start. We can&#39;t just let them do everything they pleased!&#34; Hunter mumbled, he was old but I cannot just ignore his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will talk to the other Alphas. And by the looks of it they also received the exact attacks.&#34; This time I couldn&#39;t just ignored the facts that she might actually connected to everything that is happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But one thing is for sure I need to know everything about that woman. And I know exactly that the people in my pack wouldn&#39;t tell me anything about her. So I have to do something, I need to see her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if I did, I would never let her go. Because this time she will lead me to where those Rogues are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our talk I went upstairs and found Sarah, she was still sleeping. I held her still flat stomach. I need to make sure that my child would have to live normal without worrying if rogues will attack or not. I don&#39;t want to let him feel the same suffering her mother had, losing all the people she love which almost cause her insanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning...&#34; Sarah mumbled, still half asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah wouldn&#39;t be able to shift for a while because she was pregnant. Which makes it more dangerous for her if another attack happened. Because she wouldn&#39;t be able to protect herself because shifting will hurt the baby inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34; I whispered then kissed the top of her head. This is what I should think of, not that woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to focus on the future of my son and my soon to be wife. And the only way to do that is to actually end the war and eliminate everyone who tried to stop us. No matter who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you look so serious? Your baby will notice that his Daddy was being grumpy.&#34; I held her hand and kissed it. Feeling guilty that I wasn&#39;t beside her when the attack happened. And if something happened to her and my child, then I wouldn&#39;t be able to forgive myself anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah have done everything for me and all I did to repay her was nothing but pain. I took everything to her, her happiness and life with her mate and her Dad that she loved the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just remembering how his father died by the hands of rogues only gave me another reason to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I mumbled, she then shake her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing happened to me last night, and I know something happened to you that&#39;s why you suddenly vanished. Like always...&#34; Her last words was a whisper but I did heard them and I couldn&#39;t blame her for it. She was right to be mad at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fell unconscious, because an unbearable headaches. And I keep seeing things, and this woman.&#34; She straighten herself upon mentioning the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; She sounded intrigued and worried? Or was she nervous about something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember the time you saw me in the East Mansion. That was the time I saw her, but I know it was all in my head but then I keep seeing her in my head. And I know who she was.&#34; I uttered, I don&#39;t wanna mention what happened last night because it will only lead for her to be more worried and right now she don&#39;t need to be stressed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know who she was?&#34; She repeated my words with disbelief and suddenly her face looks pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she was one of the Royalties. And she was the one the you all keep mentioning before.&#34; I uttered, and her face became more pale. Like i&#39;ve said something I shouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We mentioned?&#34; I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait Dwayne look I c-&#34; before she could finish her sentence I pulled her into a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you did warned me about her and I did ignored it. I&#39;m sorry that I didn&#39;t tell you about it.&#34; I mumbled, feeling embarrassed about all the time that I was with her but keep thinking about that woman with blue-gray eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh... Don&#39;t worry I understand that everything was confusing after everything you&#39;ve been through. Especially after loosing most of your memories.&#34; She mumbled, she looks like she was relieved about something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for always being there for me Sarah. I couldn&#39;t think of anything if it wasn&#39;t because of you.&#34; I mean everything I said to her. And after knowing who that woman is, or at knowing that she do exist and wasn&#39;t just in my head. I could now focus on Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that I will always be here for you Dwayne. And now I wasn&#39;t alone. We are going to be here for you.&#34; She smiled whole holding her tummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right, this time I wasn&#39;t alone anymore.</p>
