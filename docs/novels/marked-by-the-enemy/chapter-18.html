                <p>Standing at the classroom door, I felt eerie as students passed by, staring at me and smiling. Some of them even winked at me which felt weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nero said that he was leaving the companies, the pack, and packing up to move here, it felt so unexpectedly and stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what was even more abrupt was when he brought home Blake, and now he is suddenly dating her half-sister. What the heck was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not the fresh start I imagine, standing outside of one sister&#39;s classroom while he was elsewhere doing who knows what with the other one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Nero since we were little, I didn&#39;t know him to be a player, nor someone interested in anyone, so all these sudden things felt absolutely insane and odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, hottie!&#34; A girl mumbled as she and her friend walked past me holding hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slightly, her friend nudged her and whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t you know that&#39;s Blake&#39;s mate? It&#39;s the hottest news right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, it&#39;s also said that Blake is somehow a wolf now. Even her father uplifted the banishment on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one time I come to school late, I have missed so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake&#39;s mate? How ironic! This is all Nero&#39;s fault for dragging me in his shit. Now, I am somehow the fake mate of an alpha&#39;s daughter that I hate to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, cutie.&#34; An omega whispered as he walked by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear if another person calls me some stupid ass name, their face and my fist will confront each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my gaze into the room, I stared to where Blake was seated and saw that she had her head resting on the desk. She had been like that since entering the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew she wasn&#39;t sleeping because I had heard her sniff a couple of times which only means she was silently crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugly crier,&#34; I subconsciously whispered with my gaze glued to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly she raised her head and looked to the right, glaring at me with a death stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I cast my gaze the other way, feeling chills down my spine. I swear Blake makes me scared sometimes with her aggressive attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for a while, the lecture was finally over, and I stepped a few distances away from the doorway and waited, lowering my head so I wouldn&#39;t meet anyone&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of minutes had passed and Blake didn&#39;t come to me, I raised my head and saw that she was walking down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable! She ditched me. Annoyed, I ran after Blake, and when I caught up to her, I grabbed her arm and turned her around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you running off to?&#34; I mumbled, feeling impressed at how well she could mask her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A place called, &#39;None of your business!&#34; Blake uttered, her voice was brusque.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching her energy, I smirked and teased, &#34;Is that how you speak to your mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Blake mumbled, screwing her face into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mad expression looked annoyingly cute, and I faintly chortled, fighting back my laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home, Jason. As I told you this morning, I don&#39;t need a bodyguard. I am just fine.&#34; Blake said, turning away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I grabbed her arm and pulled her towards me, a bit too hard, and she bumped into my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart suddenly skipped a beat, and I immediately screamed in my head, &#34;What the fuck was that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go!&#34; Blake whispered, in a low, yet edgy tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I pulled my hand away from her, forcing my gaze off her angry eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to class, and you don&#39;t need to follow me, okay?&#34; Blake said, tilting her head to the right to look me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t answer, she frowned and said, &#34;Jason!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without answering Blake, I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets and walked past her, heading down the hallway without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with him,&#34; I heard Blake mumble before I turned left, down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived outside of the campus, I pulled my hands out of my pocket and started running at full speed, blocking my brain from all thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I stopped when I reached my hotel, breathing in deep as I stared at the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to think about what happened back at the campus, I walked into the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, Jason.&#34; Harley, the stunning hotel receptionist shouted out to me as I approached the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I whispered as I entered the elevator, knowing she could hear me since she was an omega.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the elevator came to a stop, I got out and kept walking at a fast pace until I reached room 402.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I entered my room, I dropped flat on the bed and gazed at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nothing,&#34; I whispered to get my thoughts straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Repeatedly, I kept thinking those words until I fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my ringtone forced me to wake up, and after pulling my phone out of my pocket, I realized that it was already four o&#39;clock and that it was Nero calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I answered the call, I heard Nero say in a sharp tone, &#34;Where are you guys!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words made me fully awake, and I sat up, resting my feet on the cold tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in my hotel room?!&#34; I mumbled, striving to make sense of his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Blake there with you?&#34; Nero asked, his voice still harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Jason, Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I was confused and a bit worried because she should have gone home by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I mumbled, striving not to think the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck! Where did you leave her?!&#34; Nero shouted, sounding really pissed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back on campus, this morning. She asked me to leave her alone, so I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the heck, Jason!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you shouting at me! I didn&#39;t sign up for a babysitting job! Also, she&#39;s your responsibility, not mine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! Forget about it. I will find her myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could ask Nero if he had tried calling her, he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I stared blankly at the wall, wondering how the heck he was going to find her if she had her scent mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abandoning my thoughts, I woke from the bed and rushed out of the hotel room, not knowing what the heck I was doing or where going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got into the hotel lobby, I took out my phone and called Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The number you have dialed is switched off. Please try again later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning, her interaction with her family wasn&#39;t pretty to say the very least, and her stepmother looked like a wicked witch, and I get why Blake was so hostile to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it now, I get why Nero is freaking out, and why my heart is pounding widely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After arriving outside of the hotel, I stood on the sidewalk, turning around like some kid lost in the grocery store and can&#39;t find their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, where the heck are you,&#34; I mumbled out loud, looking left then right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I turned right and started running, keeping my ear alert as I sniffed every second, trying to pick up her scent, hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slightly losing control</p>
                
                
                
                <p>************Nero POV*************</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crazy, that&#39;s how I felt, driving around town, looking for someone whose scent is hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking Luna shopping, I returned home to find the house empty and no Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking she was still on campus, I went back there, searched everywhere like some fool, and she wasn&#39;t there either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worst-case scenario keeps playing in my head, and I am driving around, wondering if she is somewhere, bleeding and wounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Blake&#39;s wolf is powerful, she just had her first transformation last night, so she is still pretty unstable and vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, she&#39;s like a new pup with a lot of anger issues and hate which is only making her wild and aggressive, like a teenager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The annoying part is that the sky was turning dark. A fraction of me wants to back home and check if she&#39;s finally back, but another part thinks she is out here, in a terrible situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After driving for some time, I brought the car to a stop and called Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he answered, the first thing he said was, &#34;Have you found Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Where are you now?&#34; I mumbled, drawing a breath to come down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looking for Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you check back to my place and see if she&#39;s home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to end the call, Jason abruptly said, &#34;Nero, you know we need to talk, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we don&#39;t,&#34; I mumbled before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After tossing my phone on the seat, I grabbed the steering wheel tightly and drew a deep breath, allowing my wolf to awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at my red eyes in the V mirror, I concentrated for a moment and then shut my eyelids, regaining consciousness of my full power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every sound in the state came rushing into my ear all at once and it hurt my brain a bit. But I ignored the pain and started trying to concentrate on what Blake&#39;s voice sounded like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a while, then I finally picked it up, &#34;Hey, is this the changing room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise in the background was filled with music, people&#39;s laughter, and a lot of other disgusting sounds which made me question where the fuck she was and why she need to change clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your first shift at this club?&#34; A girl&#39;s voice echoed in the back, and I squeezed my hands tightly around the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a frustrating few seconds for Blake to say, &#34;Yep, I need the cash, and I&#39;m glad that Dice hires without any requirement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I snapped out of my alpha state, turned the engine on, and logged in to, &#34;Dice Club&#34; location in my GPS before driving off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After following Siri&#39;s direction for a few minutes, I finally brought the car to a stop on the sidewalk of a shady-looking building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My emotions were off the chart, and I took a moment, looked into the mirror, and pulled my hoodie over my head as I deeply inhaled, calming myself down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived in the building, I kept my head low, and shoved my hands into my jacket pocket, listening in the direction of Blake&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, sir, but you can not go back there. It&#39;s for employees only!&#34; A voice stopped me in my tracks, and I slowly raised my gaze to see a built guy about my height glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to draw attention to myself, I walked over to an empty seat and sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I relaxed back on the couch, I caught sight of an omega moving toward my way, and a sense of annoyance sparked in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, an alpha who keeps his scent. Me likie!&#34; She said, taking a seat beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I need less drama, I ignored her presence and looked the other way, hoping that Blake would come out soon and I will get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, I felt a hand on my lap, and I glared at her, staring at me before winking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your hands off me!&#34; I mumbled, clenching my jaw as I tried to calm my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sure that a handsome alpha like yourself has a stunning omega at home to warm your bed, or do you not?&#34; She said before slowly rolling her tongue against her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strip club, of all the places she could work, why the fuck will she choose here!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you here to drink or offer yourself?&#34; I heard Blake angrily mumble under her breath. &#34;What an ass!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment I looked up and my eyes met with her angry gaze as she stood a few distances away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s eyes were glued to Blake, but she was solely staring at me with her arms crossed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little thing, what&#39;s a hottie doing here!&#34; A drunk creep shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Blake looked his way, he licked his bottom lip and stood up. But in that instant, I stood up and approached her, and he suddenly sat back down, nervously staring down at his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached Blake, she gave me a dirty look and muttered, &#34;Why wear a hoodie to hide your face when your tattoo neck is going to give you away anyway. Next time, settle for a turtleneck shirt instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she tried to walk past me. But I stepped in her way and said, &#34;We are going home, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your place to tell me what and what not to do!&#34; Blake calmly uttered, yet her eyes bore the same stubborn look from this morning in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to stay calm, I paused and then asked, &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Blake didn&#39;t answer, I felt my heart pounding in my chest as if it had forgotten the pattern of its beat, and I blurted out in anger, &#34;Are you a stripper now?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; Blake mumbled, her face red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly everyone&#39;s eyes were on us, and I could feel them all staring at Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strip for us!&#34; Someone yelled from the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the entire club was noisy with people continuously chanting, &#34;Strip for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not a stripper! I am a waitress and you need to get out!&#34; Blake screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not without you!&#34; I mumbled, grabbed her arm when she tried walking past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving her the chance to struggle, I lifted her off the floor and threw her over my shoulder, resting my palm on her booty because of how short her skirt was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put me down!&#34; Blake whispered, struggling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t stop, I will spank you!&#34; I mumbled, tightening my grip on her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My clothes are back in the changing room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got a lot. You don&#39;t need those.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A perfect question that I had absolutely no answer for, so I kept walking with my eyes fixed ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you are not going to answer, then put me down!&#34; Blake mumbled, hitting her fist hard into my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; I whispered, feeling annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put me down, or I will scream your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, don&#39;t you dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us, and I felt her clenched tightly onto my jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; I mumbled, realizing what her silence meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you please put me down,&#34; She said in a choked voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder, and I stopped in my steps and turned around to see that creep glaring at me with a smirk on his lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard the pretty thing. Put her down.&#34; He mumbled, smirking widely like some pervert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word, I carefully took Blake off my shoulder, and the entire time, I could see his smile getting broader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Blake was standing on her own feet, I focused on him. But he tilted his head to the right to stare at Blake, and rudely said, &#34;You are a waitress, right? Get me a&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fist stuck the rest of his words in his throat when it slammed into his jaw, sending him swinging to the table beside us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I stared at him, wanting to take out my anger on him. But then again, I wanted to get Blake out of such a place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned to face her, she pouted, but I ignored her stare and said, &#34;We are getting out of here now, and that&#39;s final!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to grab her hand, I suddenly felt a sharp pain hit my head,  and I turned around, staring at that creep with a broken bottle in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay,&#34; Blake muttered, voice croaky from suppressed sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her words, I rushed for that fool, jumped on him, and clawed my fingers into his shirt, not giving him a chance for escape or defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allowing my wolf to take control, I dragged him to the table and violently slammed him into it, landing my fist in his face, and I continued punching him even though his skin was soaked with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;m going to be sick,&#34; Blake whispered, and my hand stuck in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I darted my gaze around, realizing that everyone&#39;s eyes were on me and their lips were wildly parted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is a part of why I never let him handle things, and why I haven&#39;t transformed. The aggression that comes with my wolf was merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After letting go of his shirt, I rubbed the back of my hands on his clothes and turned away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I caught up with Blake, I reached for her hand, but she pulled away and mumbled, &#34; Don&#39;t touch me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked away, heading out of the club, and I followed after her, frustrated that I slightly lost control again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focus on me and relax</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***************Blake POV*******&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride to the villa was silent, and when Nero brought the car to a stop, I pushed the door open and got out, slamming it shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anger keeps putting me on the edge, even though I was trying to get my emotions under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered the house, Jason suddenly popped out of nowhere and shouted, &#34;You found Bl?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes widened as he stared at me and muttered, &#34;Blake,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I mumbled, looking at the look of concern in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his gaze abruptly danced over my head as he uttered, &#34;You found her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and she is now a waitress!&#34;  Nero sarcastically said as walked past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Jason asked, raising a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I cast my eyes on Nero&#39;s broad back and lashed out, &#34;You were the one who said that you won&#39;t help or support me anymore! So I got a job!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At a strip club!&#34; Nero shouted, looking back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your problem?! Can you make up your damn mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so!!! Fuc!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing into my eyes, Jason gave a half-smile and mumbled, &#34;You were at work? You had us worry thinking that you were hurt or in trouble. What happened to your phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;We.&#34; That word made my heartbeat a little faster as I eyed Nero, realizing why he was so pissed, and yet I still felt annoyed that he was because of Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s broken. I threw it at a wall this morning. That&#39;s why I kind of need the money to be able to buy a new one. So I got a job because of someone&#34; I mumbled, pouting as I stared down at the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not going back there!&#34; Nero said, his voice was thick with authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Shouldn&#39;t you feel relieved that I am becoming independent?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see that creep! That building is filled with them. The things I heard in that place! You are not going back there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find! I will get another job then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flared in Nero&#39;s eyes, and he shoved his hand into his pocket as he said, &#34;You want money that bad?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I mumbled, slightly clutching my fist as he approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he stopped, grabbed my wrist, and stretched my hand out, putting a card in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There! Now, stay away from shady places!&#34; Nero said with delicate disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring down at the card in my hand, my tears dropped on it, and I felt my blood boil with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want your stupid money!&#34; I shouted, tossing the card to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Jason whispered my name, and I looked his way before glaring back at Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not attaching myself to you when you are ashamed to be seen in public with me. So take your stupid money! I have no use for it, and I&#39;m getting a job!&#34; I calmly said in a firm voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Nero&#39;s eyes glowed red, and I felt my body grow weak as I stared at him, even though he wasn&#39;t doing anything to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All she did was get a job. Maybe it wasn&#39;t the best place, but&#34; Jason whispered, pausing as he looked at his alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home!&#34; Nero coldly said without taking his eyes off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, maybe&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at Jason, my heart was crying that he wouldn&#39;t leave because Nero looked really furious, and I was scared, especially after seeing him beat up that slime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess this is my cue to leave,&#34; Jason mumbled, looking away from me with a guilty expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he was about to walk past me, I grabbed his wrist and held my breath, realizing that Nero&#39;s expression had grown darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wouldn&#39;t hurt you,&#34; Jason mumbled without looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I let go of his hand, doubting every word he had said, and yet, I was hoping he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my eyes fixed on Nero, I kept still, pinching onto my skirt as my heart forgot a beat every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I heard the front door slam shut, I felt a shiver run down my spine and I stood still, swallowing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Nero took a step towards me, and I took a step back, tightening my fist to stop myself from trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he moved his hand, I turned around and ran for the doorway, forgetting to turn the knob to open the door and just kept yanking the handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was pounding like crazy as memories flooded my brain, blocking my mind from reality and keeping me stuck in the nightmare of my past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every hit, every scream, every taste of blood on my tongue, every bruise and stitches, I remember it all, all at once, and I screamed to let out the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the darkness slowly started to fade when I felt Nero suddenly hug me from the back and his hands around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another anguished howl escaped my lips as I struggled to wake up and come back to reality as Nero squeezed me in his arms, and whispered, &#34;I am not going to hurt you. I will never lay a hand on you. I&#39;m sorry, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AaaaaaAaa!&#34; I screamed, letting go of the door handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a step back with me still in his arms, Nero&#39;s voice was soft as a whisper, &#34;It&#39;s okay. Let it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Striving to calm down, I grabbed onto his wrist tightly and deeply inhaled, clawing my nails into his skin while striving to stop trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl. You are doing good.&#34; Nero mumbled as he guided me towards the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he slowly squatted, taking me along with him until we were both sitting on the floor, his back against the wall, and me cuddling in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your audacity sometimes makes me forget what you have been through,&#34; Nero whispered, resting his head against the wall. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I wouldn&#39;t harm you. I know how to cage him when it comes to you. Just like in the p&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words moved me to tears, and it wasn&#39;t long before I started crying my eyes out, unable to stop because of how emotional I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Nero whispered, looking down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing his hand under my chin, he raised my head to meet his eyes, and I sniffed softly, staring into his calm gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he suddenly leaned in, I didn&#39;t have the strength or the willpower to pull back. The enticement I felt from his stared had me weak, helpless to my core that my mind went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his lips touched mine, I shut my eyelids, feeling his hands reach on my side and pull down my skirt zip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he pulled my clothes down my hips, I grabbed his arms when he slightly tugged on my bottom lip before leaning in closer and kissing me softly until it deepened into something intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was spark and heat, and they poured into me, seared through me, drowning me so deep into a passion that my mind remembered nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I felt my back resting gently against the floor and his weight above me, I knew we both were going to regret this in the morning. But there was no ending to this fire that has blazed uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squeezing his jacket tightly, I heard Nero whisper, &#34;Focus on me and relax, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I squeezed his arm&#39;s harder as my legs split up, and I felt him slightly inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to relax,&#34; Nero whispered, biting on my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he expect me to relax when I knew how huge he is? But then again how the heck did we get here again. Every day, I seem to be drawn to him even more, although all I want to do is run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, it&#39;s not going to fit,&#34; I whispered in tears, squeezing his jacket even tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the heck does the second time still hurt just like the first, even though it had been only a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word, he reached his hand on my back, hugging me tightly before pushing in, making me scream while pulling on his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like it can go all the way in,&#34; Nero mumbled, looking into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at his face, my senses slowly started coming back, and I frowned, feeling upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Nero mumbled without moving his hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I murmured in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously focusing on something else at this moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to focus on me, didn&#39;t I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to get over the memory of this morning about him and Luna, I placed my hand on his chest, lightly shoved him, and said, &#34;This isn&#39;t happening. Please move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey now,&#34; Nero mumbled, lowering his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m done. I don&#39;t want this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be kidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pull out, Nero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment he stared at me, his brows snapped together. Then he did as I said, and I sat up from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not your toy for when you are hony,&#34; I calmly uttered, reaching for my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?&#34; Nero calmly asked with his eyes on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play dumb with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this about Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bingo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us for a while before Nero said,  &#34;I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all I was going to get from him, and I knew it from the look on his face. So not wanting to argue anymore, I hugged my clothes in my arms and stood to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a breath, I turned away from him and mumbled, &#34;Bastard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then with my head held high, I walked away, heading up, striving to not lose it even though I was pissed off with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertain feelings</p>
                
                
                
                <p>************Jason POV***********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I walked into the dining room, I met Nero sitting at the table, and when his eyes locked with mine, he slightly frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; Nero abruptly mumbled, taking a sip of his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s Blake?&#34; I uttered out loud, forgetting to say it in my head as I planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us as his eyes stared back at me cold and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he suddenly stood from his seat, drank the rest of his drink, and hit the mug on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s been going on in your mind lately?&#34; Nero asked as he walked towards me, his eyes cold as steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. It&#39;s just that things were pretty tense between you and her last night, and I&#34; I mumbled, pausing when Nero was only a foot away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression told me that he didn&#39;t trust the words I said, and even though it was a part of the truth, there was more to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the night Blake went into heat and my wolf picked up the scent of her pheromones, my brain had been messed up, and recent events just keep making it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury blazed in Nero&#39;s eyes as he maintained eye contact with me and commanded, &#34;Get rid of such thought about her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you want me to?&#34; I blurted out, even though I already knew the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The death look in Nero&#39;s eyes scared me to the core, and yet, I was prepared to ask the question again because I needed him to say it, to say that he didn&#39;t have feelings for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, I didn&#39;t leave the villa immediately because I feared the look in Nero&#39;s eyes and thought that he was going to lose it. But now, I wished that I didn&#39;t stay, then I wouldn&#39;t have to find out that they are having sex, even though I kind of guess that already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you want to know?&#34; Nero asked as he shot me a withering look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I mumbled, pulling my gaze off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never have I gone against Nero because he had been my Alpha since we were pups because he was next in line to our pack leader, and I wasn&#39;t planning to start now over some uncertain feeling that I am not sure about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I&#39;m heading out. Blake is still sleeping. Make sure you don&#39;t lose her today.&#34; Nero said, and I stared back at him in dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,&#34; I heard Blake&#39;s voice, and slowly, I turned around to meet her calm eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at Nero and me, she gave a soft smile and then mumbled, &#34;I&#39;m going to make something for myself. Do you guys want anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling even more freaked out about her calmness, I eyed Nero, and instantly, our eyes locked. I guessed he and I were feeling the same way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh, sure,&#34; I mumbled, wondering why she wasn&#39;t raining down terror on us today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying her gaze off me, she calmly stared at Nero and asked, &#34;How about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m heading out,&#34; Nero mumbled, his expression clouded with a look of doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not changing her calm expression, Blake faintly sigh and said, &#34;Okay,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she suddenly approached Nero, and I held my breath wondering if this is the time she explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The card,&#34; Blake mumbled with her gaze solely on his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Nero uttered, looking as shocked as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want me to work, so hand me the card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rigright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoving his hands into his pocket, Nero&#39;s brows lowered, and then he drew his hand out, taking out one of his cards and handing it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Blake whispered with a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked away, leaving me questioning what the heck just happened and what kind of dream she had last night to wake up in such a good mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word to me, Nero walked past me, and my eyes followed him for a while before his back disappeared out the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I heard the sound of Nero&#39;s car engine fading out of the yard, Blake walked into the dining room with a tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she set it on the table, took out a plate, and rested it on the table before placing the next plate and two glasses of juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You good?&#34; I mumbled, feeling a storm was hiding behind her calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Blake mumbled as she turned around to face me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mood, it&#39;s different this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that&#39;s because we have come to terms with our differences and situation when it comes to Nero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, I studied her face for a long while and then murmured, &#34;Okay, so&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She finally listened and accepted that Nero and I are not meant to be, and it&#39;s time to stop getting emotional over him, even though he&#39;s the cause that we are,&#34; Blake mumbled, taking a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly Blake, what&#39;s going on between you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. At least, right now, it&#39;s nothing, and it&#39;s going to stay that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into her calm expression, I could tell that she meant every word that she had said, and her eyes stayed steady the entire time she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was this supposed to mean? I didn&#39;t want to think about it since I knew the damage it could course if my wolf and I start having such ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At eight-thirty, the Uber came to a stop, and Blake got out before I did. Then we both headed into her classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we walk through the door, Nero was already in the room, and his head turned to us, but his eyes were solely on Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she and I walked past him, she didn&#39;t look his way as she mumbled, &#34;Good morning, Mr. Fang.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she headed to the back of the class and sat down. Following her lead, I took the seat beside her before staring at the stunned look on Nero&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Karen, Blake&#39;s classmate who I hate because of how obnoxious she acted the other day, walked into the room, approached Blake and me, taking the seat next to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension that immediately arose in the atmosphere was drastic, and I gazed at Blake&#39;s hand as she created a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does it feel to be useful for the first time in your pathetic life?&#34; Karen whispered, eyeing Blake with a smirk on her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better than being the same old boring nasty bitch that people only tolerate because her father is powerful,&#34; Blake said in a calm tone without even looking her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Karen slapped the desk and stood up, raising her hand as she swung it toward Blake. But acting out without hesitation, I jumped to my feet and caught her wrist in my grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, Noble. I told you not to disrupt my damn class! Now, get out!&#34; Nero uttered with a note of anger in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your filthy hands off me!&#34; Karen screamed, staring at me with a steady, hostile gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anger spiked in me as I felt my fingers tighten around her wrist a little before I drew my hand back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the fuck do you think you are touching me!&#34; Karen shouted with mad eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she threw her gaze on Blake and lashed out, &#34;You will pay for your insult! You and this, this!! Ahaha!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karen, I don&#39;t think I respect your father just so you can be disrespectful to me and a member of my family.&#34; I heard a familiar voice, and Karen&#39;s face went dull with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I looked to the doorway to see Loki walking further into the room with Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her eyes on Nero, she rushed over to him, hugged onto his arm, and whispered, &#34;Father said he was coming here to speak to sister, and I came along to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the only response she got from Nero was a smile, and the harder I stared at his expression, I could tell he was faking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have known Nero like forever, and I have seemed him give that smile to a lot of the elders in the pack that he hates or does like touching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to see me for, Loki?&#34; Blake asked, her voice flat, deadened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we talk outside?&#34; Loki calmly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, Blake sneered and mumbled, &#34;Speak here or forever hold your peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of embarrassment flared across Loki&#39;s face as he lightly coughed and then mumbled, &#34;I want to take you shopping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need,&#34; Blake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No disrespect to you daughter. But tonight&#39;s event is going to be filled with very powerful people, and I need you to look respectable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But I don&#39;t need your money to do that. So keep your generosity for others that are not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking a bit annoyed now, Loki scowled and said in a sharp tone, &#34;Blake, you got nothing to your name. Stop being stubborn when you are broke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who says I am broke?&#34; Blake sarcastically said. &#34;Loki, I don&#39;t need you or your money. So why don&#39;t you accept that and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The dress that I want you to wear is worth thousands of dollars, can you afford something like that?!... Now, stop acting headstrong and come with father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t refer to yourself as such, and I&#39;m well taken care of! So thanks, but no thanks!&#34; Blake said, sounding pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile on her lip, Luna fixed her eyes on Blake and mumbled, &#34;Sister, is your mate that good at taking care of you that you will openly refuse father&#39;s help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Blake kept silent, I followed her gaze and my sight rested on Nero, and I knew whatever he was up to, it was a recipe for disaster by hooking these two sisters to him.</p>
