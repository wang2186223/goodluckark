                <p>&#34;What exactly is the surprise? Couldn&#39;t you have told me in advance?&#34; I dragged my chin with my hand and felt the vibrations in the carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart had been soaked in honey, especially when I saw this carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a pumpkin carriage that Isaac had custom-made, and his words &#34;I&#39;m going to give you a fairy tale honeymoon&#34; were still echoing in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since it&#39;s a surprise, of course, I can&#39;t tell you in advance, I promise you&#39;ll like the surprise I&#39;ve prepared for you.&#34; With a mysterious smile on his face, Isaac pushed my hands away from my chin and held me in his arms. In order not to spoil the surprise he had prepared for me, I forced myself not to meet his eyes, lest I accidentally overhear the surprise he had prepared for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression gradually became enjoyable as I smelled the smell of ebony and cedar on him and looked at the pumpkin carriage decorated like a fairy tale setting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were now like a prince and princess in a fairy tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was the first day of our honeymoon, and he took me to the legendary vacation sanctuary, the White Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The White Pack was a neutral pack and one that advocated peace. It was said that they had great scenery and had many vacation paradises, but I never had the time to experience them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just a slave until I was eighteen years old and barely ever saw the outside world. After I became the negotiator, I didn&#39;t have time to do such a tour either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had only heard the name of this pack before, which made me feel excited about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The destination is ahead. Will you get off here, or do you want to get off at a specific spot in the pack?&#34; I heard the soft voice of the carriage driver in front of me. Through the gap in front of the carriage, I could see that he was concentrating on driving the carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the gap was small, and because of the light, I had no way of seeing my surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if Isaac had had it designed on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the center of the pack.&#34; Isaac&#39;s face still had a smile on it, especially when he looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every minute our eyes locked, an uncontrollable sweetness welled up in our hearts and then manifested itself in a smile on our faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Exactly what is it, so mysterious.&#34; I pretended to pout in anger, but I didn&#39;t expect to be greeted with a swift kiss from Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened at his pupils that seemed as captivating as caramel, then I quickly shifted my eyes to his hair, his golden brown hair falling from his ears, the tip of his nose brushing against my face, a warm hand slowly stroking toward my chest, a comforting sensation that almost made me scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of my body rushed up to my cheeks and I pretended to bite his lips hard before I turned my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing? The coachman is still ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter; he can&#39;t hear a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to his words, I glanced toward the gap ahead, and I noticed that although the coachman was concentrating on driving the carriage, there was something imperceptibly stiff about his frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You liar!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pounded him on the chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed quickly in our flirtation, and suddenly I felt the vibrations around me stop for a moment, and I knew we had arrived at our destination, and Isaac took out a piece of gauze at that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I did not resist his action and had some expectation in my heart, because he did not just blindfold my eyes, even my nose covered. I could smell the mint on the gauze, which kept me from smelling anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll know when the time comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice seemed to hide a smile inside, then I heard the carriage door open and he carefully protected me from behind me as I walked down the steps of the carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go back and meet us at the door in the evening.&#34; At that I heard Isaac emphasize his tone. &#34;Remember, don&#39;t enter here without any urgent business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, my honored guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking too much about it, I felt Isaac grab my hands from behind my back as the sound of the pumpkin carriage faded into the distance and led me toward the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was beating faster with his movements, and I imagined what I was about to see. What was it? Was it an elaborate cake? Or a big party? Or maybe it was something else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I felt the ground beneath me become soft and I knew it was the touch of earth, and at the same time I felt even more surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earth? Where exactly was this place? Did he take me to the forest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was pondering, Isaac&#39;s exhaled breath came to my ears. &#34;Claudia, you can take your gauze now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice amplified the anticipation in my heart to the maximum, and I nervously removed the gauze from my eyes, but the next moment my pupils were infinitely dilated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the sight in front of me in disbelief, and even my breathing stopped along with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Purple, pink, red, yellow, many colors arranged in ribbons blocked my vision completely, and the whole world seemed to become an illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An incredible aroma rushed into my nostrils. I looked around those colors, suddenly could not help but let out a shriek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, you also know witchcraft?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the world in front of me. I was in shock. Tulps, roses, violets, lavender, and many more flowers that I couldn&#39;t name, these flowers were arranged into an ocean that engulfed everything in my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so beautiful, a sight that should only be seen in fairy tales, but I actually saw it, as if I was dreaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia, are you satisfied with this gift?&#34; Isaac&#39;s hot breath blew from my ears, and the scent of his breath mixed with the flowers, almost making me dizzy in a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks! I&#39;m really so satisfied, this place is like a dream, such a romantic scene that I could not even imagine before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This estate is huge, there are still a lot of flowers you haven&#39;t seen. Follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along with Isaac&#39;s voice, I suddenly felt a force grab my arm, and then my body began to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You run so fast!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed happily. It was really so beautiful here. I almost never laugh so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved my palm down and pressed it against the palm of his hand. The warmth of his palm seemed to extend to my heart through my palm. We ran freely in the sea of flowers, and it was as if this was a world that belonged only to him and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huge windmills were lined up all around, and they were slowly rotating. Sometimes there would be breezes blowing from all directions, and the scent of the flowers would be different with each breeze, and I was engrossed in the different scents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breathed heavily, sucking the scent of these various flowers into my lungs as we sprinted towards the center of the estate that held more flowers ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never run so freely and surrounded by so many flowers, and I was with the person I loved. I felt a happiness at this time that I had not felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like a fairy tale! From a slave to a negotiator, I never imagined that one day I would be dating the person I love in such a fairy-tale world. It was a miracle!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We immersed ourselves in the beauty, letting all the flowers fill our lungs, and only stopped when we could barely run. Isaac laid down in the middle of the flowers, and I leaned against his chest at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, it&#39;s amazing that we&#39;re the only two people enjoying such a beautiful place, they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re missing.&#34; I gasped in his chest, looking at the cloudless sky overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, people always find beautiful things, except I made a deal with the owner of the estate, so all day today, the beauty of this estate only belongs to us.&#34; He breathed just as heavily and seemingly with such unrestrained pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All day today! My God, how much did it cost you to get the owner to say yes to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s our honeymoon, it&#39;s our time, and I&#39;m going to give you the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hot breath with the scent of flowers blew over, my heart became sweeter and I wanted to hold him tighter, but I suddenly saw him lower his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only had time to let out a startled sound before he kissed me on the lips, and then his tongue entered my mouth. His tongue chased my tongue and we changed our saliva.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breathing became more intense from his kiss, while I felt his hands reach under my skirt and the warmth of his body almost wrapped around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Isaac! This is on the estate! What if someone sees us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had some nervousness. Although I said something to contradict him, I just knew that in my heart I was expecting his next move. The comfortable feeling of powerlessness left me with no way to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s no one on this estate today, this is a world just for us, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head at that moment and I saw the smirk on his face.</p>
