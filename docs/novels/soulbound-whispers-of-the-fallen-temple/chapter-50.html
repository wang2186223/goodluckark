                <p>The air was cooler outside and Volencia wrapped her arms around her chest. The moon was high, a thousand stars twinkling in the sky. Damion was warm beside her, his arm draped around her back with a hand resting on her hip. &#34;It&#39;s beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? The night?&#34; She asked, her eyes settling on the chartis tree as their lackadaisical pace brought them ever closer to the place she wanted to be more than anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion chuckled, &#34;Well, the night is nice, yes. But I was talking about this feeling. This happiness and peace you bring me.&#34; He opened the curtain of leaves and she stepped in, unsure how to respond. &#34;Honestly, I was just driving myself mad trying to stay away from you.&#34; Grabbing her hands, Damion pulled her toward the swing. &#34;Would you like to sit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s okay. I&#39;d prefer to stand. I know you&#39;re exhausted, why don&#39;t you sit?&#34; He did, pulling her close so that she stood between his thighs, and put her arms around his neck. He closed his eyes as she ran her fingers through his hair. &#34;I make you feel at peace and you make me feel safe and strong.&#34; Kissing his forehead, she caressed his cheeks. &#34;I want to crawl into bed with you. It&#39;s the only reason I want to be back home again, where no one would be watching us that closely. Or at least where we have a secret passage to use to get to one another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion held her close. Pulling her face down gently to meet until their lips connected. He wanted to climb into bed with her too. Though he wasn&#39;t sure how well they would actually sleep when that finally happened. As exhausted as he was, her touch spread fire though his veins. Even now, he could barely control himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your lips your touch you drive me wild.&#34; He mumbled between kisses. Sitting on the swing left him at the perfect height to trail kisses down her throat and collar bone. Letting his fingers trace along the inside of her bodice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped as his hand closed around her breast, his thumb rubbing over the pert mount of her hardened nipple. &#34;You keep doing that, and I&#39;m not going to let you stop&#34; She moaned quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia stumbled suddenly as he got to his feet, pulling her up into his arms and against his chest. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; She giggled, relaxing into him as she held the veil of leaves aside for him to walk through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Begging Travion to stall for as long as he can so that we can have more time I want to take my time with you.&#34; Volencia blushed up at him, her heart now pounding in her chest. His voice deepened with desire, his eyes dark with lust. As he reached the door to his home, Volencia reached down to open it for him. As soon as they were  in, he kicked the door closed behind him, setting her on the counter, devouring her lips in a passionate, uncontrolled kiss. His fingers fumbling with the buttons at the front of her dress. His wrap tunic was much easier to maneuver and she had him shirtless before he&#39;d gotten even a quarter of her dress undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought with his belt, moaning impatiently as it refused to give way. Taking a step back, Damion freed himself while she took the opportunity to undo her dress, pealing the layers away as quickly as she could. When his pants fell around his ankles, she froze, taking in the view of him standing before her completely naked. She was only half undressed, but he was just as stunned. The first to move, she reached down, her fingers grazed his erection. He growled low in his throat, sending a shiver of desire up her spine as he dove into her breast, pushing her back onto the counter to lay there as he suckled, kissed, and trailed his lips over her. She arched into him, her body needing so much more of him. Every time a moan escaped her lips, he growled back in response. His hand dipped into her skirts, lifting her tush from the counter to free her from the restraining fabric. He trailed fire from her neck, to her breasts, and then further down over where her soft skin dipped away from her hips. Her legs were restless, and she was unsure what to do with them as they half dangled off the end of the marble slab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion stepped back, repositioning himself between her knees. He pulled her toward him gently, until her bottom was perched at the end of the counter. His dark eyes studying her body. &#34;Don&#39;t stop!&#34; She pleaded, arching toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, &#34;No. Not tonight. We&#39;ve both waited too long for this.&#34; Letting his hands roam, he enjoyed watching her squirm beneath him. When his hand found the intimate folds of her womanhood, she cried out, her hips jerking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to scream, &#34;I want more!&#34; but the exclamation only came out as quiet, desperate plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me.&#34; The words were nearly lost in a growl, and every time he spoke, her body responded with a desperate need to have him. All of him. He gently pulled her hand from where she gripped the edge of the countertop, and ran it down her body until she felt the wet juncture between her legs. &#34;Show me what to do.&#34; Moving of their own accord, her fingers moved over her pearl, eliciting a response that made her body convulse. She wasn&#39;t sure what to do either, she&#39;d never touched herself in this way before. But as her fingers explored, she found the spots that provided the sweet agony she was looking for. When she dared to look up at him, she nearly lost control of herself. His eyes watched her hungrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned over her, moving as if in slow motion. Hovering over where her hand moved of its own accord. His tongue flicked out experimentally at first, but soon suckled on her fingers, and then moved to that pearl of unbridled lust, taking over where her fingers were meeting the same rhythm of movement he&#39;d been watching her use. Unneeded where they were, Volencia&#39;s hands reaching up to wrap her fingers in his hair. Within moments of his lips meeting her skin, she was trying desperately to pull him into her, which only excited him more. Her hips wouldn&#39;t behave as they moved up and down, and all she could do was beg, her knees hooked over his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his fingers boldly moved to her opening, she signed, straining, waiting for him to enter her. &#34;Is this what you want?&#34; His fingers teased her deliciously. Her legs tightening around him as she cried out, &#34;Yes!&#34; Her words guided him, deeper, faster whatever she commanded, he did. Until finally her body couldn&#39;t take it anymore. As she convulsed around him, spasming, and moaning, he couldn&#39;t wait any longer. His hands slipped away briefly and he pulled her up from the counter. &#34;I need you. I can&#39;t wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering her into his arms, Damion laid her back into his nest, settling over her. &#34;Wait&#34; she exhaled, &#34;You lay down. I want to see you too.&#34; A blush crept over his skin, from chest to cheek, as she pushed him back into the nest. He shivered under her as she smiled down, devouring him with her eyes, &#34;it&#39;s my turn, love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike her, he laid back, closing his eyes as she played. His chest and stomach were smooth and hard, but nothing compared with his shaft. Her hand danced over him, but when he arched, he grabbed at her wrists. &#34;Volencia&#34; he was panting, &#34;I&#39;m not going to last like you. I&#39;m barely holding it in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding her body up his, he gave a primal growl. She hovered over him, holding him at her entrance. His fingers gripping the blanks beneath him like his life depended on it. As she slowly lowered herself onto him, she leaned forward, whispering, &#34;I want you to lose it.&#34; Like a vise, his hands whipped up to grab her hips and thrust himself the rest of the way into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move.&#34; His eyes gleamed up at her, but he looked like he was in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; She worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah&#34; he panted, &#34;give me a moment. I don&#39;t want this to end, but&#34; his fingers tightened, and Volencia stayed as still as she could, holding her hands in the air. Sweat dripped from his temples and dappled his chest and stomach. Just looking at him was beyond enjoyable. He was beautiful. She wondered if that was why he was keeping his eyes closed? Did looking at her affect him the way looking at him affected her? His breathing started to even out, and Damion opened one eye to peek up at her. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia shifted, &#34;Don&#39;t be. I could stay like this with you forever.&#34; He relaxed a little under her, opening both eyes to let them roam over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the sweetest torture I&#39;ve ever known. You&#39;re amazing.&#34; Her hands met his chest again, and let her nails graze over his skin. When she made slow circles over his hips and lower stomach, he inhaled sharply. Engulfed in desire, his eyes were nearly completely black now. &#34;I can&#39;t&#34; In one lithe movement, Damion pinned her in the nest and thrusting into her with a fierceness she lost herself in. She grabbed at his arms, his neck, and back, gasping for air as he drove her over the edge. When he growled, she bit back a scream, both felt they&#39;d exploded into a million pieces. Clasped together, shaking in each other&#39;s arms, Damion rolled off her, but kept her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tightened her legs around his waist, &#34;We are one.&#34; She giggled, &#34;Was it worth the wait?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every minute.&#34; He nuzzled close, holding her tightly, both their bodies slick. &#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m leaving my bed again&#34; He closed his eyes sighing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone is waiting for me to go back though, and Trey is probably already fighting your mother to stay in the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably.&#34; He only opened on eye to peek at her as she pressed her hands against his chest. &#34;Come on, help me button the back of my nightgown.&#34; Volencia cooed at him as he pouted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Untangling themselves, Damion handed her a towel to clean up with. As he buttoned her nightgown, his finger trailed her skin teasingly. &#34;My beautiful Princess I can&#39;t wait to see you in some of the other nightgowns you&#39;ve already teased me with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, eyes sparkling. &#34;I just can&#39;t wait to tease you all the more, for the rest of our lives.&#34; She wrapped her arms around him, kissing him deeply. &#34;My husband, father of my child one day, you&#39;ll be my king. I love you so much.&#34; His lip pulled into his mouth as he looked away, his brow pulling together. Whatever she had said, something was bothering him. &#34;You okay?&#34; She asked trying to force his gaze back to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes closed, as she succeeded. &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m just exhausted. Whatever I had left went into making love to you. The only thing that could possibly make this day better,&#34; his gave met hers again, &#34;would be curling up in that bed with you by my side. I&#39;ll go with you back to mom and dad&#39;s. I don&#39;t want you to get scolded alone for taking so long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense.&#34; Volencia laughed, watching him pull on the baggy pants he&#39;d usually wore to bed. &#34;I&#39;ll just tell her you needed to be tucked in. I&#39;ll send Trey along too. You go get your rest. You&#39;ll mother won&#39;t be as eager to give us a hard time if I&#39;m the only one who shows up.&#34; She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing her gently, he said, &#34;You are my hero.&#34; He opened the door for her. &#34;Saving me from all sorts of uncomfortable family moments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Says the elf that saved my life.&#34; She pushed him toward Travion&#39;s home, waving as he slipped in silently.</p>
