                <p>He didn&#39;t look at her with rage anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even with defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just looked at her like someone who had always known this was inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe it had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias let out a sharp breath, tilting his head slightly as he studied her. &#34;You think this makes you better than me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley arched a brow, her voice calm. &#34;I think this makes me the one who&#39;s still standing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle in Tobias&#39;s jaw twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rough, sharp sound that lacked amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped a hand across his bloody mouth, exhaling through his nose. &#34;You have no idea what you&#39;ve just done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t blink. &#34;No. I think you&#39;re the one who has no idea what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;You think taking my wolves means you&#39;ve won?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley tilted her head slightly, watching him. Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias chuckled again, shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you don&#39;t know who the real enemy is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his voice made the air go still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves behind her shifted, uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped closer, his body still rigid with tension. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias looked up at them now, and for the first time, Riley saw something different in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something closer to warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think this ends with me?&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s fingers twitched. &#34;You were the one hunting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias scoffed, rolling his shoulders. &#34;No, little wolf. I was the one trying to keep you from being found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, cold dread curled inside her, sinking into her ribs like a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias exhaled sharply. &#34;You&#39;re not the only one who remembers what you were.&#34; His golden gaze flickered in the dark. &#34;And now that you&#39;ve done this now that you&#39;ve made yourself a threat again they&#39;ll come for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, visceral chill spread down Riley&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because she was afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But because somewhere deep inside her she already knew he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran took a step forward now, his voice sharp. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias&#39;s lips curled slightly, but it wasn&#39;t a smirk. It was something colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The ones who erased her the first time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit like a physical blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley felt her chest tighten, her breath coming slower, heavier as if the very air around her had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Tobias wasn&#39;t lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That strange pull in her bones, the memory of something bigger than this war, bigger than Tobias, bigger than anything she had ever understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just the pack she had once ruled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was something older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that had seen her rise before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And had made sure she fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley swallowed hard, forcing herself to hold Tobias&#39;s gaze. &#34;Who are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias exhaled. &#34;The ones who decide who gets to stay in power.&#34; His eyes narrowed slightly. &#34;And you, little wolf? You were never meant to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sent a sharp pulse of heat through her blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley clenched her fists, but she didn&#39;t break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because whoever they were, whatever they had done to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had still won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she wasn&#39;t afraid of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran turned to her now, his golden eyes storm-dark with something heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley inhaled slowly. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Riley&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not running.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his fists. &#34;You don&#39;t understand what this means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned to face him fully, her gaze unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand perfectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Tobias had tried to erase her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had hunted her, chased her, tried to bury her in the past where she belonged and he had failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, someone else would come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone who thought they could erase her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they didn&#39;t know her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t know what had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted her chin slightly, a slow fire curling through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind stirred around them, the wolves watching, still waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias let out another rough, quiet laugh. &#34;You think you can win this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-she smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer until she could see the flicker of unease beneath Tobias&#39;s mask of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she was done losing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was done being erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.She was going to end it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled through the clearing, sweeping through the gathered wolves, rustling through the trees like a whisper of something ancient something that had been waiting for this moment just as much as she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias&#39;s smirk had vanished, replaced by something colder, heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of something like acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he knew this wasn&#39;t his war anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was still beside her, still stiff with tension, but he wasn&#39;t stopping her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he knew too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had known before anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That she wasn&#39;t the same girl he had met in Silverwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t a lost soul fumbling in the dark, trying to understand what she had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was something bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that had been here before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time, she wasn&#39;t going to be erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned her gaze to the wolves watching, still waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had chosen her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because she had beaten Tobias.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because she had proved she was stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But because they remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they couldn&#39;t explain it, even if they didn&#39;t know why</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they were waiting for her to lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, deliberate breath filled her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had taken back the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this wasn&#39;t just about them anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Tobias had given her something more valuable than his wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had given her a name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimpse of the true enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had erased her before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who would come now, the moment they realized she had risen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow heat curled beneath her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a long, long time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was exactly where she was meant to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization settled deep in her bones, like a key clicking into place. The weight of everything, the past, the power, the wolves waiting for her command didn&#39;t suffocate her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire inside her raged wildly, and no longer fought to be controlled. It burned steady now, sharp and sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she wasn&#39;t running from it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was claiming it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled slowly, lifting her chin, letting the moment settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Tobias one last time, the man who had tried to bury her in history, the man who had fought so hard to keep what he had stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wasn&#39;t the story anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can leave,&#34; she told him, her voice calm, certain. &#34;Or you can stay and watch how this ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias&#39;s golden eyes flickered. His body tensed like he wanted to argue like he wanted to throw one last challenge at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because there was nothing left to fight for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias let out a slow breath, wiping the blood from his mouth. &#34;You have no idea what&#39;s coming for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s lips curled slightly, but it wasn&#39;t quite a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then they should be afraid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned away from him, her gaze sweeping across the pack of the wolves who had once belonged to Tobias, who had once served him without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they were hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow murmur rippled through them, a shift, a silent acknowledgment of what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of what she had just become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped forward, his golden eyes locked onto hers, storm-dark with something unreadable. &#34;What now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let the question hang between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because that was the real thing, wasn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had taken back the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had stood her ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But surviving wasn&#39;t enough anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t here just to exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was here to end this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire inside her pulsed, steady and strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Kieran, at Lena, at the wolves still watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, softly, she said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We get ready for war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words settled over the clearing like a thunderclap, rippling through the gathered wolves, sinking into the cold night air like a promise or a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they all felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The inevitability of what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley saw it in their eyes, in the way their bodies tensed, in the way some looked relieved, and others looked afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this wasn&#39;t just a fight anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t about Tobias.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about something bigger than all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that had been waiting in the shadows, watching, waiting for the moment she became strong enough to be noticed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned to Kieran, to Lena, to the wolves who had chosen her. She was done reacting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was done being hunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If war was coming she would meet it head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t fighting alone.</p>
