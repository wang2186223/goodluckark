                <p>Toby&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the negotiation was extended, the Crimson Shadow pack&#39;s attitude towards Claudia became worse and worse. They even instigated their children to throw stones at Claudia. The reason why the negotiation broke down was clearly that your Alpha cheated! I wanted to tell everyone, but Claudia told me to ignore them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia asked me, &#34;Do you think they believe in their own Alpha or the witches representing other packs?&#34; I could only endure it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Claudia came here, I could see that she was unhappy. She didn&#39;t eat much. Every day she went out to look for something. So I couldn&#39;t see her. Looking at her slowly becoming thinner, my heart also ached. No matter how strong she was, she still needed someone to accompany and protect her. I didn&#39;t know if she was affected by Isaac&#39;s forceful kiss that day. My intuition told me that I had to make a move. Otherwise, I would regret it for the rest of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used all the affection I had for my short 18 years of life to confess to Claudia, but she seemed to be frightened by my sudden confession. After a while, I still couldn&#39;t hear her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I stroked her silver-white hair. &#34;Please see the real me.&#34; I slowly moved closer to her lips. God, I wanted to do this for too long. I hoped she wouldn&#39;t push me away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia still looked like &#39;What happened?&#39;. Then I was pushed to the edge of the table by a huge force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay away from her!&#34; Isaac roared in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With just a little finesse, I could have broken Toby&#39;s spine as I pushed him away. But I knew he had a special status, and it was best not to ruin the peace talks between the two packs because of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered the door, I saw Toby preparing to kiss Claudia. If this was nothing, what made me the angriest was that Claudia had no intention of avoiding him at all. What was their relationship? I prayed to Moon Goddess that she must not tell me that they were together. Otherwise, I would not be able to resist killing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jealousy and possessiveness drove me. I grabbed Toby by the neck and pressed him onto the table. He actually wanted to shift! His courage was worthy of praise. He was one of the few werewolves who had not peed their pants under my threat. My claws slowly pierced into his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia scolded me from behind, &#34;Isaac! Let go of him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her plead for Toby, and I felt even more upset. Toby struggled under my hand, not knowing if he would suffocate first or if his carotid artery would be cut open by me first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a black shadow flashed in front of my eyes, and my other hand grabbed the claw that Claudia was waving at me. Her nails were less than a millimeter away from my eyes. She warned me, &#34;Let go of him, don&#39;t force me to use magic against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he so important to you?&#34; In order not to hurt Claudia, I let go of Toby. He held the table and coughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is one of our pack&#39;s people. Do you want to start a war like this?&#34; Claudia did not mention her relationship with Toby. I was a little happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw that he wanted to harass you just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who wants to harass her?&#34; Toby felt better. &#34;You have already dissolved the relationship. Why do you still want to disturb her?&#34; I always felt that he gave me a familiar feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Are you saying that I disturbed your good thing?&#34; Strangely, I did not have that much hatred for the fierce wolf cub in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34; The little wolf bared his teeth at me. It seemed that he had to be punished. I continued to let go of my aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! Both of you!&#34; Claudia&#39;s face was dyed with a thin layer of red from anger, making her look extremely sexy. &#34;It&#39;s too embarrassing. Two adults are quarreling like children here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, we&#39;re all doing this for you.&#34; I wanted to see more of her blushing face. Sure enough, Claudia&#39;s neck also turned red, making me want to reach out and touch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Claudia grabbed my hand and shook it off. &#34;I don&#39;t need your help.&#34; Then she turned to Toby and said, &#34;We&#39;ll talk about you another day. It&#39;s inconvenient for him to be here.&#34; Claudia pointed at me. &#34;Now all of you leave. Let me stay alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby and I spoke almost at the same time. &#34;What is it that I can&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34; Claudia was angry. Her eyes lit up with green flames. In order not to make her more disgusted, I could only leave her house with Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it that I can&#39;t know?&#34; Toby looked still in a daze, but I didn&#39;t care. I had to know what they were hiding from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby didn&#39;t expect that I would talk to him. &#34;Ah... What does it have to do with you? If Claudia doesn&#39;t want to tell you, I won&#39;t tell either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you afraid that I will kill you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, do you think I&#39;m afraid of you?&#34; Tsk, what a loyal puppy. If not for Claudia protecting him, I wouldn&#39;t have cared to use private torture. But looking at them, I could guess what was going on, so I planned to trick him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know why Claudia rejected you?&#34; I asked Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t refuse me! She just didn&#39;t answer!&#34; He blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it! The way this kid looked at Claudia made me uncomfortable. And I didn&#39;t understand why Claudia didn&#39;t refuse him. This made me sick of it again. I pulled Toby&#39;s collar and said, &#34;Don&#39;t be delusional. She won&#39;t like you. Besides, she&#39;s mine. You&#39;d better not be stupid enough to steal her from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to say that he was much better than Neil. Although his hand that wanted to pull off my collar trembled slightly, his eyes still stared at me fiercely, just like a wolf protecting its food. I heard from Andre that he was the child of the White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha. No wonder he had the courage to pursue Claudia. I remembered my past, an illegitimate child without a father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Isaac!&#34; A guard next to Andre called me. I let go of his hand and Toby fell to the ground. The guard ran over and told me that Andre had something urgent to talk about with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lucky. There won&#39;t be the next time,&#34; I said to Toby, who was lying on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I arrived at the house, Andre was slumped in his leather reclining chair. He smelled so strongly of alcohol that I swore if he had specifically asked me to come and watch him get drunk. I would have sneakily punched him in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here.&#34; He sat up from the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, he looked sober. &#34;What?&#34; I had no patience for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all that bitch&#39;s fault. Our plan failed.&#34; He waved the bottle in his hand indignantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say? What plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me. &#34;Forget it. Since the negotiation was unsuccessful, we should think of other ways.&#34; I motioned him to continue. &#34;Aren&#39;t you very powerful? How about taking your men to kill the White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you crazy?&#34; I looked at him incredulously. &#34;Now we are in a state of armistice. And why should I go? You even don&#39;t let me participate in your usual combat meetings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre suddenly went berserk, and he threw the bottle to the ground. &#34;We want victory! Not some bullshit peace talks!&#34; He approached me, and the smell of alcohol on his body made my eyes hurt. &#34;If you kill their Alpha, I will let you come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha! Do you think I care about this? You can find anyone else who wants this damn job. I won&#39;t do it anyway.&#34; I was about to leave, and he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t care, so I brought what you care about.&#34; He asked the guard to bring a woman tied up, whose head was covered in a black cloth bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put the woman in front of him, put his claws on the woman&#39;s neck, and then pulled off the cloth bag on the woman&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother&#34;</p>
