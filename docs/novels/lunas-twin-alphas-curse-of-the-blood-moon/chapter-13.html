                <p>Damon POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my body force itself awake, as if Alpha commanded to. My eyes opened with a jolt. Allison was glowing and holy sh*t did she ever look hot as ever right now. Her small pink party dress, replaced with a beautiful long gown, small pink flowers patterned all over it. Wait is that blood? I panicked thinking it was her own, but I then saw Summers&#39; limp body in the corner her limbs at odd angles and her skull crushed. Is it bad that the thought of my mate killing her so fiercely kinda turned me on? After trying to process everything that happened around me, I noticed something else, I was only wearing boxers. Where did the rest of my clothes go? I quickly realised it was most likely apart of one of Summers&#39; twisted games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison then spoke again, but the voice was not her own. It was the voice of a powerful goddess, her aura held more power than any Alpha I&#39;ve ever met. I watched as she walked towards the cell bars and they blew to pieces without even a touch. The same happened with the steel door, we continued on into what looked to be an old cellar, and up some old wooden stairs. She pushed open the cellar hatch and we came out into the bedroom. The same bedroom I could smell her scent the strongest in, I was so close to finding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean walked into the bedroom a moment later holding his heart, I wanted to rip his head clean off his shoulders. He then yelled at my mate and I was about to kill him, when out of nowhere his skull was crushed by an invisible force, and his body flung to the wall. Allison looked as shocked as I did by this, but we didn&#39;t want to waste anymore time so I grabbed her hand and led her out of the room towards the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her hand slip from mine and turned around just in time to catch her as she fell, she was no longer glowing. In fact, she went from looking full of life and power, to looking sick again. I called her name, hoping for an answer but it seemed she was sleeping. The use of power must have drained her. She still had a steady heartbeat so I tried not to worry too much. I knew I had to get her out of here, I had no idea if they had others working with them. I was about to exit the house with Allison&#39;s sleeping body, when I heard a voice I never thought I would hear again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon?&#34; he said weakly as he drug himself out from behind the kitchen counter, he must have recognized my scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy sh*t, Chad? How are you alive, I don&#39;t understand, I saw your body?!&#34; I felt relief wash over me at seeing my bestfriend and beta alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tricked you, Summer tricked you and she tricked Lena. She had me tied up against the wall out of sight, I don&#39;t know what she did to me, I couldn&#39;t talked or mindlink you. I tried to warn you but she blocked it quickly somehow. How did you get out?&#34; He then noticed Allison&#39;s body in my arms,&#34;Will she be okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allison killed Summer and I think Dean but without even touching him she killed him, it was crazy man, she had all this power, she was glowing. When she spoke it was like the power of a goddess. Her aura was stronger than any I&#39;ve ever seen. She will be okay, I think she just used too much power at once. What happened to you, what did they do to you?&#34; I asked, worried for my friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Summer was using my blood to strengthen herself, she kept going on and on about how the ritual couldn&#39;t be performed until a full moon, which thankfully for us wasn&#39;t for another week. When she tested my blood and realized I am Alpha blooded, she said it would have to do until she can create something more powerful using Allison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get you both out of here, do you think you can hold on to Allison and keep yourself on if I shift into Apollo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I can manage.&#34; He said weakly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure if he had the strength to, but right now it was our quickest way out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Lena, did you see what happened to her? What about our warriors?&#34; I asked, I prayed Lena wasn&#39;t killed before Allison got the chance to meet her. She was the only family she had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The warriors are all dead, Summer couldn&#39;t shut up about it. They let Lena go, she tried offereing herself in Allisons&#39; place, said she was too old and weak to bear a child for them even though she carried the gene, she said she would do anything to save Allison. Lena spelled Dean and Summer, right in front of them, a spell that bound her to Allison, they needed Allison for their ritual, so they knew they couldn&#39;t kill Lena, they had no choice but to let her go.&#34; He said. I could see him fading quickly after all of the talking, so I carefully layed Allison down, and helped Chad off of the ground. We made our way to the door, Chad insisted on walking through it himself, he knew I needed to help Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking her up bridal style, I carefully slid through the door and met Chad outside. He then took her in his arms as I shifted into Apollo. Just I shifted, we heard someone bounding towards us. I took a protective stance in front of Chad and Allison. But when I recognized the wolf coming towards me, I quickly stepped aside, revealing them to her. Lena shifted back into human form and came running the rest of the way towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she alright? Chad, you&#39;re alive! Oh goddess, I thought you were dead, I thought it was all my fault. I was in the woods, I&#39;ve been watching this place. Waiting for my opportunity to kill those f*ckers. They underestimated me. Pfft, old and weak my ass.&#34; She snarled as she reached an arm out and touched Allisons&#39; hair. It was a gentle touch, the kind you would expect from a grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s okay, she had some kind of power, I think it drained her too much. We need to get my two men from the hotel and take her home  I said through mindlink as I was still shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get on his back, I will place spell binds that will keep you both on. Fell free to rest too Chad, you look like hell.&#34; She stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I did come back from the dead didn&#39;t I?&#34; Chad chuckled, but then started coughing. I was happy to see that he still had a sense of humour given his state. Apollo layed down to make it easier for them to get up. Chad placed Allison on my back first, and then he joined her. Lena flicked her wrist and I felt the binds wrap under Apollos stomach and around Chad and Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena then shifted into her wolf and together we headed to the town to get Greg and Rory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had made it to the hotel in just over an hour. We stopped so I could mindlink Greg and Rory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are at the edge of the woods, I need you both to get the Suburban and drive over here, we are going home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two &#34;Yes Alphas&#39;&#34; came down the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, we watched them come out of the room and get into the Suburban, they then drove towards the edge of the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena shifted back into her human form and spelled herself some clothing. Greg and Rory got out of the vehicle and made their way to Chad and Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get ready to catch them.&#34; She said the them as she undid her spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greg caught Allison, Rory caught a now sleeping Chad. Chad was placed in the far back, Allison in the middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted back to human form and Lena spelled a pair of shorts and a tshirt on me. Greg and Rory took their seats in the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena and I carefully lifted Allison and placed her into our laps. I had her feet, Lena had her head. She was stroking Allisons&#39; hair with tears in her eyes. The ride to the air strip was silent, we all piled out of the vehicle upon arrival. I carried Allison onto our private jet, while Greg got Chad. Lena and Rory filed behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad was placed on the loveseat and seatbelts placed around him so he didn&#39;t roll off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully the Jet had a large room in the back that contained a queen sized bed, so I layed Allison back there and couldn&#39;t help but lay there with her, wrapped up in my arms. Soon after the jet had taken off and we were finally on our way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of my mate next to me calmed me enough to let sleep take over.</p>
