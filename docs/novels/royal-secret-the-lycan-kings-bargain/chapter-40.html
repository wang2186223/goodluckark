                <p>Settling himself in between her legs, he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just lean on the couch and relax, Layla&#34; he whispered as he removed his mouth from her nipple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take care of the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla never expected to hear those words coming from him. She had never thought he would say such an intimate and gentle line to her. And now she could not help but be alarmed because that line just turned her on damned hard. She could feel her heart racing as her cheeks warmed up from his words alone. Who knew Nolan had this side of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt his lips on her shoulder as his hands moved from her waist, caressing her skin until he reached her breasts. The moment he squeezed her there, a silent gasp escaped her mouth. Oh dear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your breasts are so soft, &#34; He whispered huskily as he continued massaging her breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat started to break out on her temples and forehead. And when he rolled her nipples between his pointer and his thumb, another gasp was torn from her lips as her whole frame trembled within his hold. Her eyes squeezed shut as she could not help but drop her head back on the couch. She had wanted him to touch her down there earlier, but he was just as good with the way he handled her soft molds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, just like that my princess. Relax and just let me prepare you until you&#39;re ready for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not what she was expecting. At all!! Oh, good lord. He was not supposed to whisper these sweet words with his erotic and deep voice while touching her with burning strokes like this. He was not supposed to Wait, what was he not supposed to do? Layla could feel herself spinning out of control as her mind somehow just could not make sense of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought they would just have sex and get done with everything but now he was showering her with sultry words. Mind blowing words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another twist on her nipples had her letting out a sharp sound. A sound she could not believe had originated from her own lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trailed his tongue from the spot just below her ear, down to the dip in her shoulder. His tongue was so hot. Like liquid fire that was threatening to burn her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel powerful muscles bunching and tightening under her ass and thighs as he continued touching her everywhere, except below her waist. She wanted him to touch her more, in there. But he only took his time and played with her breasts with ruthless and delicious patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spread your legs wide open for me, Layla&#34; He commanded in a deep, vibrating voice. His hand had ever-so-slowly and finally crossed below her waist and was now resting on her legs. To be specific, it was placed right on her upper thigh. His palm was so hot, it was as though a flaming brand was being placed there, marking her as belonging to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla found herself obeying without any struggle, wanting him to bring his fiery hand to touch her now aching place so badly. Her face was blazing red as she opened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wider.&#34; He breathed, giving her a sharp nip on her earlobe. That almost tore another sharp sound from her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not enough. More. Yes! Just like that. Mmm That&#39;s my good girl&#34; he murmured words of encouragement and satisfaction when she did according to his wishes. Normally, she would have found this appalling and demeaning even. However, what he was doing was only causing the heat to burn even hotter down there. She could feel herself getting so wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla could only shut her eyes, whether in embarrassment or anticipation, she did not quite know as she felt his hand trailed on the insides of her thigh. Intense anticipation gripped her as she waited for him to touch her there, where she was most sensitive. But again, he took his time, delaying and making her wait, driving her crazy. But all she could do was bite down on her lip and stay docile and patient in his arms. She did not want to beg him like some desperate and wanton woman again. But oh lord this was much harder than she had ever anticipated. She had not expected for herself to be stuck in such a situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly moved his hands to her waistline, ripping her panties off her body. Layla soon began to marvel if he preferred tearing the clothes of his sex partners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his fingers finally brushed across her there, Layla heard his curse rumble low in her ear. &#34;F*ck. Look at that wet pretty p**sy&#34; these words left his mouth as he suddenly palmed her center. &#34;Do you know do you have any idea on just how wet you are right now? Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not know what she should say. Her mind was no longer working normally as before. Her mind was blurred, and her focus was fixed on nothing else but these delicious sensations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I d-don&#39;t know&#34; Was all she could stutter out with labored breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine I shall show you then.&#34; He replied delightedly before starting to play with her folds, sliding his fingers up and down with sweet shallow motions. And without warning, he sunk his finger into her wet entrance. Elle stiffened at the invasion of his thick and blunt fingertip as she stifled a sound that he had elicited from her. &#34;Easy there&#34; he whispered, &#34;relax your body, Layla&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That coaxing deep voice was like magic that had relaxed her jolted nerves. And before she knew it, she could feel nothing but pleasure as her focus was fixed to where he was touching her. Her whole universe had sharpened and was fully concentrated on that one place. Until his finger was sliding in and out inside her in a delicious rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck.&#34; She heard him curse again. His voice seemed to be getting more strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he suddenly stopped and pulled his finger out of her. A protest was about to be torn from Layla&#39;s lips when he lifted his hand right before her face. The moisture on his finger all the way to his palm had her eyes stretching wide in embarrassment and shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is how f*cking wet you are right.&#34; He drew and then he moved his hand towards himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla turned her head over her shoulder to look what he was going to do with it only to see him putting his finger inside his mouth and wrapping those seductively sexy lips around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck.&#34; He cursed after licking his finger clean. &#34;You&#39;re f*cking delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted and she felt like her mind froze out in another shock. His expression was as though he had just tasted something glorious. And what he had just said and did, as well as his expression and the look in his eyes drove spikes of something intense through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered her again, impaling his finger inside her as his one arm hooked around her throat again, pinning her against the couch. He glided his thick and long digit in and out of her as the heel of his hand ground against her nub. His actions sent pleasures shooting through her that left her gasping and moaning helplessly as she arched and jerked around in his hold. She had thought that being restrained; it would be an unpleasant experience. However, what she was feeling so far is nothing but heavenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon he added another finger to the one already effortlessly gliding in her depths. The heel of his hand moved in circles against her sensitive nub in a rhythm so perfect and mouth watering that she could feel her head spin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan.&#34; she began to call out his name between her ragged breaths when he increased the pace and pressed the heel of his palm down a little harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly stopped his fingers just when she started to writhe uncontrollably in pleasure, causing her to nearly cry out in protest. He seemed to be waiting for something for a moment. Was he waiting for her to beg him to continue? Or could he be deciding if she was finally ready for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, Layla could no longer take it. Pure instincts took over her body and her hips moved on its own, her hips grinding herself onto his hand. And he cursed again. This time, it sounded like a growl rumbling in her ears, sending even more delicious shivers through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods! You&#39;re so hot. You really never cease to surprise me. Look at you, so hot..&#34;. Nolan deadpanned, he began to realize that Layla was a big temptation to him, one that he should have avoided.</p>
