                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled Jesse into the illusion that I controlled. It was dark here, but it could change according to my thoughts. Everything in the illusion was not real. It did not hurt people, but it was realistic enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; Jesse exclaimed. Ordinary people had never seen this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The magic of a witch.&#34; In fact, this was just a simple illusion. &#34;I will pull Fiona in later. If you want to know the truth, keep quiet and don&#39;t make a sound. When I call you, come out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jesse nodded honestly. This was the reason why no one dared to provoke a witch. I was secretly delighted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way to trigger this illusion was very simple. You could pull people into the illusion as long as you touched people. However, it was also very easy to crack. So I could only use this to deceive a werewolf like Jesse and Fiona who lacked the ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s wolf perception was too weak. I easily pulled her into the illusion. That place became a cliff. I tied her up and placed her on the edge of the cliff. When she woke up from the dizziness of entering the illusion, she was already standing in front of a bottomless abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhh!&#34; I waited patiently for her to finish screaming. She could actually stand up, but her legs should be soft. Fiona looked at me. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only want you to tell the truth. Did you spread the rumor everywhere that I seduced Neil?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still reluctant to admit it. &#34;What did you say? What rumor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, since you don&#39;t want to say it, then go to hell.&#34; I pushed her to the edge of the cliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona, who was tied up, began to struggle violently and was getting closer and closer to falling off the cliff. Fiona finally spoke, &#34;It&#39;s me! I posted the rumor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled her back a little. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I followed you and Neil to a garden that day, but you came back without doing anything. I could only tell Jesse that you seduced him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very good. Jesse, did you hear that?&#34; I shouted behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Why is Jesse here?&#34; Fiona&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jesse came out from behind me. She was very angry and said to Fiona, &#34;I thought you were my friend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I removed the illusion. Only then did Fiona realize that there was no cliff at all. She pointed at me and said to Jesse, &#34;It&#39;s all her. She used witchcraft to provoke our relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jesse no longer believed her, &#34;Shut up, you are a liar with a mouth full of lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Fiona&#39;s pale face. Her hair was soaked in a cold sweat, sticking to her forehead, which made her look like a clown. I could not help but sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This stabbed Fiona&#39;s heart. She raised her hand and wanted to slap me. &#34;You poor witch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed her wrist directly, &#34;I, a poor witch, can make you die without a trace.&#34; Then I slapped her with the other hand. &#34;Don&#39;t think you can do anything to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona fell to the ground. &#34;Do you think you can come back and challenge my position just because you look beautiful? I am Beta&#39;s daughter, and my father will kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ha, I thought she was going to say something threatening. &#34;Challenge your position? Poor thing, that&#39;s all you can see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she said made me feel that she was very pathetic. Just looked beautiful? She had no idea what I had experienced in the past two years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two years ago:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been two days since I was chased out by my pack. The wound caused by Fiona had not been healed yet. I dragged my injured body and dodged the nearby rouges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had only drinking the river water for the past two days. The hunger made me feel cold all over. If I did not eat anything, I would immediately faint. I looked at rouges&#39; gathering place from afar. Even if it was the trash bin there, I did not dare to take a step closer. Their wolves would definitely smell me, and I would rather starve to death than be caught by them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked for a long time, and it was almost dark when I found a camp that had been ransacked. There must be a fight between rouges. The camp that had been robbed was full of blood and corpses. There were also some things that rouges did not need. I carefully bypassed the corpses and searched for food in the camp. In the end, I found a piece of bread that had been burnt black in the already extinguished campfire. But for me, who had not eaten for two days, this was already a supreme delicacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was eating the rare food, I suddenly heard a sound. I quickly lay next to a corpse and pretended to be one of the dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I told you they were all dead,&#34; A rouge said to his companion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I did smell something different,&#34; Another rouge said, sniffing the air. He walked towards me step by step, and the &#34;corpse&#34; next to me suddenly twitched. God, he was not dead yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rouge walked to my side, picked up the &#34;corpse&#34; next to me, and then penetrated his chest with his claws. I could feel warm blood on my face and body, and then the rouge threw the body on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you can rest assured.&#34; His companion said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rouge sniffed in the air again. &#34;Well, there is no other smell.&#34; After they left, it was a while before I dared to move. I removed the body that was already stiff on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My luck was better than him. Originally, the rouge should have smelled my scent, but he woke up at the wrong time. His blood covered my smell. I numbly washed the blood on my body in the river, but I could not stop retching. My nose was full of the smell of blood and the smell of the body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In order to avoid encountering such things again, I covered my appearance and smell with soil and ate wild fruits to satisfy my hunger. When the sun was better in the day, I would find some abandoned houses and search for the materials I needed. I found some cans of old age in an abandoned room. It was enough for me to eat for a long time. Suddenly there were footsteps approaching, and I hid in a dark and narrow storeroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone here,&#34; a male voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there rouge around?&#34; a woman asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s our pack nearby.&#34; It turned out that they were only a pack&#39;s people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I still didn&#39;t dare to go out. In my current state, they would definitely think of me as rouge or a monster. I planned to wait here until they left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. I miss you too much,&#34; The woman said, and then there was the sound of fabric rubbing against each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too.&#34; Immediately, I understood what they were doing here. Sure enough, there was soon the sound of flesh colliding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect that I would run into someone who had an affair here, which made me unable to stand in the storeroom. But when I moved, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my feet. Something sharp was deeply inserted into the soles of my feet. I immediately bit my lips and told myself not to cry out. When they left the house, my feet were already cold. I pushed the door of the storeroom and found that there were many broken glasses on the ground inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried my best to take out the glass shards from the soles of my feet in the house. Some tiny glass shards had already mixed into my flesh and blood. I still wrapped my feet with a strip of cloth and left the house. It was going to be dark soon. The beasts would smell the scent of my blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, unfortunate things always happened in succession. The wounds on my feet were infected. I wanted to find some herbs to treat the wounds, but because of the infection, I had a fever. I was lying under a tree. Was this the last time of my life? Died of injuries? My parents&#39; faces had already appeared in front of me. Were you here to pick me up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold feeling on my face woke me up. I saw a woman with purple eyes. She looked very familiar. She touched my face. The cold touch came from her hands. As the god of death, was she too good-looking? As I thought about it, my consciousness fell back into darkness.</p>
