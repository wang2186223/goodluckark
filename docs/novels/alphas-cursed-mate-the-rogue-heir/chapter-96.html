                <p>Jenny&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and I walked briskly through the car park, our heels clicking against the concrete in unison. The late afternoon sun was beginning to dip, casting long shadows across the parked cars. I glanced at Bianca, who wore a look of fierce determination. Her eyes were fixed ahead, her jaw set. This wasn&#39;t the Bianca I had grown up with-she&#39;d changed, grown harder and sharper. But then, so had I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached her car, a sleek black sedan that seemed fitting for the kind of conversations we&#39;d been having lately. Without a word, she unlocked the doors, and we both slipped inside. Bianca&#39;s hands were steady as she gripped the wheel and started the engine, her eyes flicking over to me as she shifted into gear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ready for this?&#34; she asked, a slight edge to her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her gaze, giving her a small nod. &#34;Of course. We&#39;re in this together, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ghost of a smile crossed her lips before she pulled out of the parking space, her eyes focused straight ahead. We drove in silence for a while, the tension in the car almost palpable. I could feel my heart pounding as we left the familiar streets behind, heading toward the outskirts of town. We were meeting Lex, the guy Bianca had contacted, in an abandoned lot near the old church. The place was deserted, far enough from prying eyes to ensure that our conversation wouldn&#39;t be overheard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about twenty minutes, we turned onto a dirt road that led to a clearing surrounded by trees. The old church loomed in the distance, its shadow stretching across the lot like a silent witness to whatever deals were struck here. As we pulled in, I noticed a dark figure leaning casually against his car, his arms crossed, watching us approach. Lex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca killed the engine and got out, and I followed her, trying to keep my expression cool and confident. Lex straightened as we approached, his eyes glinting with interest. He was tall, with a lean frame and an air of quiet menace that told me he was no stranger to doing the dirty work others avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies,&#34; he greeted, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. &#34;Right on time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca wasted no time with pleasantries. &#34;Let&#39;s get down to business,&#34; she said, her tone firm. &#34;You know why we&#39;re here, Lex.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, glancing between us with an amused look. &#34;Getting rid of a problem, huh?&#34; He crossed his arms, leaning back against his car as if he had all the time in the world. &#34;You two must really want this girl out of the picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea,&#34; I replied, my voice colder than I intended. Lia had been a thorn in my side for far too long, her presence making everything more complicated than it needed to be. She didn&#39;t belong in our lives, and she certainly didn&#39;t deserve Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex chuckled, clearly unfazed. &#34;Well, you&#39;ve come to the right guy. I know exactly how to make problems like her disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;So, what&#39;s your plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex leaned in, his voice lowering. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of her on the day of the wedding. That way, no one will suspect a thing. There&#39;ll be enough chaos that she&#39;ll just slip through the cracks, so to speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and I exchanged a look, a mutual understanding passing between us. Lex&#39;s plan made sense. The wedding would provide the perfect cover; with all the guests and the confusion, Lia&#39;s disappearance would go unnoticed until it was far too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you can handle it?&#34; I asked, wanting to be absolutely certain. &#34;I don&#39;t want any loose ends. This has to be clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex gave me a slow, confident smile. &#34;Relax, Jenny. This isn&#39;t my first job. Once I&#39;m done, she&#39;ll be nothing more than a memory.&#34; He glanced at Bianca. &#34;All you two have to do is act normal. Leave everything else to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s expression softened a hint of satisfaction in her eyes. &#34;Perfect. Make sure she&#39;s gone by the time the ceremony begins. We can&#39;t afford any surprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex nodded, his face serious now. &#34;Consider it done. She&#39;ll be out of the picture by the time you say &#39;I do.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twisted sense of relief washed over me as I listened to him. Finally, after all the frustration and uncertainty, things were falling into place. Lia would no longer be an obstacle, and I would finally have the life I&#39;d been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shook hands with Lex, sealing our silent agreement. Without another word, he slipped back into his car, the engine roaring to life as he drove off, leaving a cloud of dust in his wake. Bianca and I watched him go, each of us lost in our own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we got back into her car, Bianca looked over at me, her eyes glinting with satisfaction. &#34;It&#39;s almost done, Jenny. Just a little longer, and everything will be perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, the anticipation building inside me. &#34;It&#39;s about time. She won&#39;t know what hit her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca gave a short, sharp laugh, and we pulled away from the lot, our plan firmly set in motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been watching them for a while, lurking in the shadows of the car park. It had taken some time to piece together the threads of Bianca&#39;s plan, but I had enough by now to be sure of one thing-she was planning something dangerous, and Lia was her target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw Bianca and Jenny walking briskly toward a car, their expressions tense and focused. My instincts flared, sensing trouble. This wasn&#39;t an ordinary drive-they were on their way to do something. As they got into Bianca&#39;s car and drove off, I followed at a safe distance. A few minutes later, they arrived at a remote lot, a clearing I recognized from around the old church. My heart clenched as another figure came into view-a man leaning casually against his car, waiting for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they stepped out to greet him, I felt my blood run cold. This wasn&#39;t a friendly catch-up. No, the look in their eyes and the stiffness of their postures spoke of something darker. I waited in the cover of trees, out of sight but close enough to catch fragments of their conversation. Just as I suspected, they were plotting against Lia. I barely restrained myself, my fingers curling into fists. But I forced myself to stay still and wait until they were finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Bianca and Jenny walked back to their car, satisfied looks on their faces, and drove off, leaving the man alone in the lot. The guy seemed in no hurry to leave, taking his time as he got back into his car. This was my chance. Staying far enough behind so he wouldn&#39;t notice me, I followed him as he pulled onto the road, my senses sharpened and every nerve on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led me on a winding drive through back streets and quiet lanes, finally heading out to a more deserted part of town. When he turned down a narrow dirt road, I took my chance. Leaving my car behind, I shifted into my wolf form, letting my senses take over as I moved swiftly and silently, closing the distance with each step. The trees and night air seemed to blur around me as I surged forward, my focus locked on him, every sense attuned to his every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled over near an abandoned warehouse, stepped out of his car, and headed toward the side entrance. In one quick, fluid motion, I shifted back to human form, striding out from the shadows and cutting off his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze, his eyes widening as he registered my presence. &#34;Who the hell are you?&#34; he asked, his voice a mixture of surprise and irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step closer, my voice low and dangerous. &#34;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m someone who knows you&#39;re working with Bianca and Jenny. And I know exactly what you&#39;re planning to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of recognition crossed his face, followed by a wary look. &#34;Look, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&#34; he said, attempting to sidestep me, but I blocked his path easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play games with me,&#34; I growled, my voice dropping to a deadly tone. &#34;I know you&#39;re planning something against Lia. And I know they&#39;ve hired you to make her disappear. So I&#39;ll make this simple-either you tell me exactly what they want you to do, or you&#39;ll regret not cooperating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed, his confidence fading as he realized he was cornered. &#34;Listen, I don&#39;t want any trouble,&#34; he said, his tone softening. &#34;I was just hired to do a job. I didn&#39;t know there&#39;d be this much interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spare me the excuses,&#34; I replied sharply. &#34;What&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, he sighed, looking down at the ground before meeting my gaze again. &#34;The plan is simple. I was supposed to make sure Lia didn&#39;t make it to the wedding. Disappear her in a way that wouldn&#39;t raise suspicion until it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw clenched as anger surged through me, but I forced myself to keep calm. &#34;You&#39;re going to forget that plan. You&#39;re going to help me instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a wary look, frowning. &#34;Help you? Why would I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because if you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re the one who disappears. I don&#39;t think Bianca or Jenny will care if you&#39;re gone.&#34; My voice was cold, each word laced with warning. &#34;So here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do: you&#39;re going to meet with me tomorrow. We&#39;re going to figure out a way to make this work in our favor, without harming Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me, his expression conflicted. I could see him calculating, trying to decide whether to take the deal or take his chances. But in the end, he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; he said, his voice quiet but resigned. &#34;Tomorrow. Just don&#39;t make me regret this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t,&#34; I replied. &#34;But if you betray me, I promise you won&#39;t be around to regret anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I turned and left him standing there, his face pale and uncertain. As I disappeared into the night, my thoughts were focused on one thing: Lia. Whatever Bianca and Jenny were planning, I would stop it. No matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>115</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the quiet of the room, the hum of the evening around me when the sudden ring of my phone broke the stillness. I glanced at the screen, and my heart skipped a beat-Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered immediately. &#34;Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; his voice was low, serious, the usual warmth missing. &#34;You need to be careful around Finn&#39;s house. Things aren&#39;t as they seem, and there&#39;s more going on than you know. I&#39;ll tell you everything when we see each other. But for now, watch yourself, especially around Bianca and Jenny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, my grip tightening on the phone. &#34;What&#39;s going on, Luca? Why should I be worried about them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll understand soon enough,&#34; he said, his voice darkening. &#34;Just don&#39;t trust anyone too easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could ask more, the line clicked and the call ended abruptly, leaving me with an unsettling feeling. What had he meant? I wasn&#39;t sure, but I trusted Luca, so I knew I needed to be cautious. Still, I couldn&#39;t let his warnings consume me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled slowly, trying to shake off the tension. I dialed Benedicta&#39;s number next, hoping for some semblance of calm. It only rang once before she picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia?&#34; Benedicta&#39;s voice was always a comforting balm to my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Benedicta. I just wanted to check-in. How are you?&#34; I asked, settling back against the pillows, feeling the weight of the day pressing down on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re doing well,&#34; she said softly. &#34;Merlin&#39;s been keeping busy. He&#39;s grown so much, Lia. I wish you could see him more often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at the mention of her son. &#34;I miss him too. Put him on, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a soft shuffle on the other end before Merlin&#39;s voice came through, a little clearer than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia!&#34; he said enthusiastically. &#34;I&#39;m building a castle with my blocks! I bet it&#39;s bigger than yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &#34;I&#39;ll have to come over and see it one of these days. Maybe you can teach me how to build one too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He giggled, and I could hear him proudly explain the castle&#39;s walls and towers in great detail. The conversation drifted to his plans for the upcoming summer and his excitement about a new book he was reading, and I indulged him, feeling a small sense of peace as I listened to his innocent chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after a few more moments, I said, &#34;Alright, Merlin, I&#39;ve got to let you go now, but I&#39;ll be thinking about that castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Lia. See you soon!&#34; he said before the line went quiet, and I was left with the sound of Benedicta&#39;s voice again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll let you go too, dear. Be careful. You never know what&#39;s out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; I assured her, though my mind wasn&#39;t entirely at ease. &#34;Thanks, Benedicta. Give my love to Merlin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, I stared at my phone for a moment before the soft knock on my door pulled me from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A maid stood in the doorway, her expression respectful but firm. &#34;Miss Lia, dinner is ready. Your family is waiting downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, setting the phone down, and stood up. &#34;Thank you,&#34; I said, smoothing out my dress as I followed her down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner table was set in the grand dining room, a beautiful spread laid out before us. Finn sat at the head of the table, his sister, Alina, seated to his left, and Bianca sitting beside me. There was an awkward tension hanging in the air, one that I couldn&#39;t quite place. As I settled into my seat, I glanced at Finn, but he was already looking away, his attention elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to break the silence. &#34;So, Finn, the wedding preparations are moving along,&#34; I began casually, hoping to engage him. &#34;I&#39;ve been working with the florist, and the venue&#39;s almost confirmed. It&#39;s all coming together nicely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn barely looked up, his gaze flickering to his plate before returning to his glass of water. &#34;That&#39;s great,&#34; he muttered, his voice distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow but pushed forward, unfazed. &#34;I was thinking we could start planning the rehearsal dinner soon, too. A few close friends, family, and of course, a few of your business partners. It&#39;ll be a good chance to get everyone in the right mood for the wedding day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Finn didn&#39;t seem particularly engaged. He merely nodded, his fork picking at his food as his sister, Alina exchanged an amused glance with Bianca. I didn&#39;t care, though. I wasn&#39;t here to talk about anything else but our wedding. If Finn wasn&#39;t interested, it was his problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;ve also been thinking about the guest list,&#34; I continued, feeling my pulse quicken with the desire to push his buttons. &#34;It&#39;s always difficult to narrow it down, especially since your father has so many colleagues and people from the business world that he wants to invite. But I suppose it&#39;s a matter of managing expectations, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn finally glanced up, his eyes narrowing. &#34;Yes,&#34; he said slowly, but his tone remained disinterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a flash of frustration but kept my smile in place. It didn&#39;t matter if Finn didn&#39;t care. This wedding was happening, and he had no say in how it would unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more uncomfortable moments of silence, dinner came to an end. I pushed my chair back, ready to make my next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like to speak with you in your office, Finn,&#34; I said, standing up from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes shot to me, but instead of responding immediately, he exchanged a look with Bianca, who raised an eyebrow in return. Alina, too, seemed to be caught off guard by my request. But neither of them said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Finn said after a beat, his voice flat. &#34;I&#39;ll meet you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned to leave, I couldn&#39;t help but feel the weight of their gaze following me. What were they thinking? What were they hiding? I would find out soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>116</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Lia left the dining room, her back straight, movements calm, as though she were completely in control. But I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was more beneath that carefully crafted composure. Why did she want to see me in my office? I felt a faint pulse of suspicion as I stood up, unable to ignore the tension that lingered between us tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I took a step to follow her, Alina approached, her expression a mix of worry and frustration. She lowered her voice, glancing briefly in the direction Lia had disappeared to make sure she was out of earshot. &#34;Finn, you need to be smart about this,&#34; she murmured, her tone sharp. &#34;Your so-called fiancée isn&#39;t who you think she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, my gaze hardening as I looked at her. &#34;What are you talking about, Alina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia has her own agenda. I don&#39;t trust her, and neither should you.&#34; Her eyes flickered with something close to desperation as if she&#39;d been holding back these thoughts for far too long. &#34;Just be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, Bianca chimed in, her voice filled with quiet resentment. &#34;She&#39;s right, Finn. Don&#39;t let Lia brainwash you into whatever game she&#39;s playing. I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s planning, but don&#39;t be foolish about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced between the two of them, irritation starting to bubble up. &#34;Bianca,&#34; I warned, but she didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it,&#34; she pressed, her tone urgent. &#34;Whatever Lia&#39;s about to tell you, don&#39;t just take her words at face value. Think, Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina turned to her, her eyes narrowing. &#34;Will you shut up, Bianca? No one asked for your opinion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca stiffened, her eyes flashing with anger. &#34;Excuse me? I&#39;m only looking out for him, which is more than I can say for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s face darkened, her lips pressing into a thin line. &#34;Don&#39;t think for a second you know what&#39;s best for my brother. I&#39;m his family, not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that they were moments away from launching into a full-blown argument. I let out an exasperated sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose as their voices escalated. &#34;Enough,&#34; I snapped, glancing between them with a hardened expression. &#34;Both of you, just shut up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They fell silent, each of them casting me a sullen look but refraining from saying more. I turned away without another word, the tension between them left unresolved but, for the moment, contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked down the hallway toward my office, Alina&#39;s words echoed in my mind, stirring up a sense of unease. Lia isn&#39;t who you think she is. I had always trusted Alina&#39;s instincts, and she rarely warned me without reason. But Bianca&#39;s words lingered, too. Had Lia been attempting to manipulate me, subtly guiding things to her advantage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached the door to my office and paused, taking a deep breath to compose myself before I walked in to face her. Whatever Lia had to say, I&#39;d hear her out. But I&#39;d keep my guard up this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in Finn&#39;s office, my hands resting on the armrests, eyes fixed on the door as I waited. The ticking of the clock on the wall was loud in the silence, each second stretching out longer than it should. The tension from dinner still hung over me, but I kept my face carefully composed, my posture steady. This was something I needed to confront, and no matter how it turned out, I wasn&#39;t going to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and Finn walked in, closing it behind him with a quiet click. He looked at me, his expression unreadable. &#34;Why did you want to see me, Lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a slow breath, meeting his gaze. &#34;I wanted to talk to you about something I&#39;ve noticed.&#34; I paused, choosing my words carefully, watching his face. &#34;I know you had me followed, Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, his expression didn&#39;t change, but I saw a flicker of something in his eyes. &#34;And why do you think that?&#34; he asked, his tone guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow, leaning forward just a little. &#34;Because it&#39;s obvious,&#34; I replied, keeping my voice calm. &#34;You don&#39;t trust me, so you need someone to keep an eye on me. You need to soothe your conscience, I suppose.&#34; I watched him carefully, seeing the faint tension in his shoulders as he stood there, unmoving. &#34;Am I right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t immediately answer, and I could see he was trying to choose his words, weighing how much he wanted to reveal. But I didn&#39;t let him speak before I continued, my voice softening just a bit. &#34;Finn, tomorrow we&#39;re supposed to be married. I don&#39;t want to start that</p>
