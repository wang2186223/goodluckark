                <p>&#34;I saw your wedding invitation. Congratulations.&#34; Miranda took out an envelope from her black robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here!&#34; I rushed up and hugged her. &#34;I thought the witches didn&#39;t like this kind of occasion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like it. But this is your wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda took off her robe and threw it on the sofa. &#34;According to your usual practice, do you have any plans tonight? I can hypnotize a handsome guy to give us a striptease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, what you said is not our practice, it is a crime. And I promised Isaac not to call a stripper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what do you want to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell silent because of her question. In fact, I never thought about how to enjoy my single party. My usual life was boring, except for the days when I was with monsters and magic. I had nothing to like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to go back to our coven? You won&#39;t have a chance to go back in the future.&#34; Miranda broke my silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since there was no other choice, it was good to go back and see. It was equivalent to the place where I was reborn. &#34;Okay,&#34; I said to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coven was still the same, no one would give you an extra glance as you walked along, and that&#39;s what I liked about it. Because I was always surrounded by disgusting eyes when I was a kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda took me to a small house. She said to me, &#34;I can feel that you are stronger than before. Can you control other people&#39;s thoughts now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I only tried it on my mate, and I almost died that time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because your mate is also very strong. I ask you to come back this time because I want you to see this.&#34; Miranda lit the candle in the room, and the dim light reflected a stone table full of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked too strange. I subconsciously took a step back. &#34;What is this?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laboratory. It is logical that your wolf can heal your spirit. You can&#39;t rely on your mate every time. What if he isn&#39;t by your side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logically? I didn&#39;t know that Nicole&#39;s ability was so strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you rely too much on the ability of the witch. There are very few hybrids of the werewolf and the witch. No one taught them how to balance their ability. I didn&#39;t want to meddle in this matter, but this is my wedding gift to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know this concerns the dignity of a witch who should not make friends. Thank you!&#34; I hugged Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right.&#34; She broke free from my embrace, but I could see the smile on her face. &#34;Now, let your wolf accept you. The abilities of witches and wolves do not conflict with each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought she had always accepted me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not enough.&#34; Miranda said, &#34;You have kept her in your mind most of the time. You are afraid that she will take control of your body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that so? I thought back to what I had done. Ever since I became a witch I had been very afraid of losing control of things, something I was a lot like Isaac. We had both lost and been hurt by many things. It was a protective mechanism for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda seemed to understand my thoughts. &#34;You have to trust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Nicole?&#39; I opened the wall in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What&#39;s wrong?&#39; Nicole was very cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I think I owe you an apology. Sorry, I kept you locked up.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole was still very unhappy. &#39;You used the methods of a witch to deal with me.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m afraid of losing control.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m not a monster! I won&#39;t lose control so easily.&#39; Nicole was excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you can&#39;t reach a consensus.&#34; Miranda pointed to the stone table covered in blood. &#34;I can forcibly activate your self-healing mode, but my methods are a little tough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t let the witch touch you!&#39; Nicole roared in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Okay! Okay.&#39; I comforted her. &#39;I know you have been concerned about me. I swear I won&#39;t force you to sleep again.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole put down her vigilance. &#39;I don&#39;t object to you controlling me, but you are not my master. We are one.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No problem. Do you want to come out now? We can shift and take a walk by the river.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole&#39;s mood suddenly became happy. She urged me to leave quickly. I looked at Miranda and she nodded at me. However, I still planned to run away. The witches did not like wolves running around their base.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hid my clothes under the tree and changed my body by the river. I could see my fur under the moonlight through the river. Nicole ran by the river. I could feel the wind whistling in our ears. We were now the freest. Nicole and I had a high level of consciousness. She finally accepted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night&#39;s walk tormented me until midnight. If not for today&#39;s wedding, Nicole would never let me go back to sleep. I rubbed my eyes and got up. Lilith had already sent me countless messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind slowly woke up. Today was my wedding. The wedding I had been looking forward to. I was so excited that I couldn&#39;t eat a few mouthfuls of breakfast. As soon as I went downstairs, I was dragged into the studio by Lilith. She carefully looked at my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time was your party? Look at your dark circles!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t hold a party.&#34; If I explained to her that I was actually running by the river, she would be even angrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilith must have seen it too. &#34;Do you know how many people vomited on their wedding gowns?&#34; All the stylists present had a tacit smile on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it, don&#39;t laugh!&#34; Lilith shouted to her team members, &#34;We don&#39;t have much time. Hurry up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna?&#34; When I was about to fall asleep in front of the mirror, a gentle female voice woke me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up and saw a familiar face. It was a girl from the greenhouse. Lilith shouted to her man, &#34;Who is she? Hurry up and drive her away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m here to deliver flowers.&#34; The girl&#39;s voice was too low for Lilith to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you leaving? I&#39;m going to get someone to drive you away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; I stopped Lilith. &#34;This is my friend. She came to give me something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; The girl smiled apologetically at me. She took out a few flowers. &#34;Alpha had specifically told me that Luna would feel uncomfortable with the smell of white flowers. So I picked these for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly felt guilty towards the girl, although she did not know that I had once doubted her relationship with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked the peony from the bouquet and said to her. &#34;Thank you! These flowers are very beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my duty.&#34; The girl gathered her courage and said, &#34;Alpha really loves you. He was very happy when he talked about you. Happy wedding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also think I am very happy. Thank you for your blessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the girl left, she poked her head out of the door and said to me, &#34;Sure enough, only a beauty like Luna can wear such a gorgeous ring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the ring on my finger. The platinum six claws were tightly clasped with bright diamonds. I didn&#39;t know when Isaac had started to prepare. I didn&#39;t even notice this. The sweet feeling of happiness had already overflowed into my chest. Now I was looking forward to seeing my Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart beat very fast. I was not so nervous when I first faced the ghoul. When I walked through the door, I held my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every second I walked on the red carpet reminded me of the time I spent with Isaac. When I was still a slave, he tried all kinds of ways to protect me. In my days of being bullied, he was the only light I had in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now my light stood on the other side of the red carpet, his chestnut hair neatly combed behind his head, his golden-brown eyes all gentle. The silver-gray tuxedo made him look much softer than usual. His figure was straight and slender, and Isaac in formal wear was simply the prince of all girls&#39; dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I saw Isaac&#39;s amazed expression. His eyes reflected golden light. Isaac stared at me, and he even hesitated when he approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so beautiful,&#34; Isaac praised. For some reason, I felt like crying at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hugged me and said, &#34;Thank Moon Goddess for letting us become mate again. I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac held my hand and we walked to the witness. Dean was the witness to our wedding. He looked at Isaac. &#34;Isaac, do you want to marry this woman? Love her and be faithful to her. Whether she is poor, sick, or disabled, until death. Will you do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked at me with his eyes shining. &#34;I do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean looked at me. &#34;Claudia, do you want to marry this man? Love him and be faithful to him. Whether he is poor, sick, or disabled, until death. Will you do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do!&#34; My voice was trembling with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you can kiss each other!&#34;</p>
