                <p>Sophia said, &#34;This area feelsspecific,&#34; her voice barely heard above the currents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s miles,&#34; Kael explained. &#34;That is where the old magic runs most strongly. It is also where our people&#39;s past comes to life the most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He motioned for her to sit on a cluster of clean rocks. As she settled in, he sat opposite her, his stance relaxed yet watchful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aquaria wasn&#39;t always like this,&#34; Kael said, his tone unwavering. &#34;Millions of years ago, the ocean became a wild, uncontrolled area. Magic was not prepared or managed. &#34;It devolved into chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia leaned nearer, fascinated despite herself. &#34;What modified?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The primary rulers of Aquaria,&#34; Kael explained. &#34;Tharros ancestors. They established the city&#39;s limits, controlled the currents, and formed strong ties with various underwater clans. However, their prowess arrived at a cost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of cost?&#34; Sophia asked, her brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s jaws constricted. &#34;They committed to the charm of the ocean. It strengthened them, but it also connected their futures to it. If the magic fails, so will they. And so does Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia let his words to soak in, the weight of their implications crushing down on her. &#34;And now the magic is breaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded. &#34;The leviathan&#39;s rising, the hunters&#39; aggression-it&#39;s all linked. The stability is fading, and we&#39;re not sure how to stop it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked down at her palms, the faint glimmer of her marks throbbing beneath the flesh. &#34;And you watched I&#39;m a part of the solution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stretched out and touched her hand. The touch sent a jolt through her, yet she did not back away. &#34;I&#39;m not simply assuming it, Sophia. &#34;I sense it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught as she met his eyes. There was depth in his gaze, a raw honesty that left her feeling exposed. &#34;Kael&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; he whispered gently, hardly a whisper. &#34;Do not say it is only a prophecy. Don&#39;t say it isn&#39;t real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia swallowed with difficulty, the words caught in her throat. She was at a loss for words and emotions. Everything she knew changed when his presence grounded her in unexpected ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant passed, but the air between them stayed electrified as Kael stood and stretched a hand toward her. &#34;Come on. &#34;Let us teach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grasped his hand and allowed him to bring her to her feet. &#34;What now?&#34; &#34;Extra water manipulation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something exceptional,&#34; Kael remarked, with a sneer on his lips. &#34;You want to learn to fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia blinked. &#34;combat? Like, bodily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded. &#34;Magic is powerful, but it isn&#39;t consistent enough. You want to be able to defend oneself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He guided her to a flat stretch of beach where the currents had been gentler. He picked up two narrow, coral-like staffs from a nearby rock and passed one to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Start with this,&#34; he said, stepping back. &#34;let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve were given.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia held the personnel awkwardly, her fingers sweaty. &#34;I&#39;ve in no way done this before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why we&#39;re starting now,&#34; Kael remarked, teasingly yet firmly. &#34;Come on. &#34;Show me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swung the staff clumsily, her movements clumsy and susceptible. Kael noticed the affects along with his own, a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, not bad,&#34; he said. &#34;For a beginner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;beginner?&#34; Sophia fired again, narrowing her eyes. &#34;allow me strive that once more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she attacked with greater force, her movements spurred by determination. Kael blocked her again, but this time his look was one of surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Higher,&#34; he acknowledged. &#34;but you&#39;re still retaining back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia scowled at him, her wrath rising to the surface. &#34;I&#39;m now not maintaining lower back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you are,&#34; Kael said, coming closer. &#34;You are afraid of making a mistake. Of losing the ability to manipulate. Stop wondering. Simply feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia tightened her teeth, his words making her nervous. She increased the workforce again, this time relying on her intuition. She moved faster, her movements were more fluid. Kael easily stopped her, but their exchange had taken on a new complexity, with a rhythm that felt almost dance-like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;exact,&#34; Kael said, his voice low. &#34;That&#39;s it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia misplaced herself in the motion, the rush of excitement propelling her to move faster and attack harder. For a brief moment, she felt invincible. But then Kael moved faster than she could follow, sweeping her legs out from beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell to the beach with a bang, the personnel slipping from her approach close. Kael stood over her with an enigmatic gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still too predictable,&#34; he replied, with no animosity in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grumbled and rubbed her elbow. &#34;you could&#39;ve warned me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;where&#39;s the a laugh in that?&#34; Kael remarked, offering a hand to help her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accepted it, her inflammation subsiding as their eyes met. His glance conveyed something more than adoration. She felt it, too, a tug she couldn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get higher,&#34; she continued, her tone softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I recognize you will,&#34; Kael said, keeping his grip on her hand. &#34;You&#39;ve already come up to now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt a warmth spread through her chest, a sense of belonging she had not had in a long time. She averted her gaze, finding the situation too intense to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they traveled back to town, Kael began to teach her more about Aquaria&#39;s history. He mentioned ancient partnerships, conflicts waged in the shadows of trenches, and sacrifices made to maintain their fragile peace. His voice became more regular, and his comments were filled with a deep understanding of his fellow humans and their hardships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You care so much about this region,&#34; Sophia said, her voice tinted with admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my home,&#34; Kael stated unequivocally. &#34;I&#39;ll do something it takes to protect it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her admiration for him increasing with each passing second. &#34;Thanks,&#34; she replied after a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34; Kael inquired, staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For helping me,&#34; she added quietly. &#34;For believing in me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael smiled, lightening his generally severe features. &#34;you make it easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s cheeks reddened, and he or she looked away, wondering how to respond. However, before she could find the words, an unexpected chill swept through the water, causing her to quiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael tightened up, his fingers moving to the hilt of his sword. &#34;We&#39;re not by myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s pulse quickened as she surveyed the darkness. The sea around them appeared to darken, as the familiar glimmer of Aquaria faded into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Live near,&#34; Kael said, his voice low and powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her heart racing in her ears. Whatever became accessible, she knew one thing for certain: her education was not over yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Echoes of the Deep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadows from the cove persisted in Sophia&#39;s mind long after she and Kael returned to Aquaria. Whatever had been watching them from the depths had vanished, but the kickback it left in her veins would not burn away. She had been getting stronger, but each new project reminded her of how much more she still needed to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, as she prepared to start her studies with Kael, a gentle knock resonated through the coral door. Sophia opened it to see Arin ready, her emerald eyes contrasting against the hallway&#39;s subdued glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;surprised?&#34; Arin asked, a smirk pulling on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Definitely, sure,&#34; Sophia said, crossing her fingers. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve spent enough time learning brute pressure from Kael,&#34; Arin teased. &#34;Now it&#39;s time to analyze subtlety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia lifted her eyebrow. &#34;Subtlety?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded and moved closer. &#34;You will never be able to grasp Aquaria&#39;s magic via raw force alone. It is alive, Sophia. It breathes, whispers, and sings. And it&#39;s time you listened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin took her to a region of town Sophia hadn&#39;t seen before. The water here felt exclusive-calmer but throbbing with strength. They passed tall coral structures that lit weakly, their light paler than the relaxation of Aquaria&#39;s bioluminescent systems. The trail shortened and led directly into a small grove hidden amid a crescent of high cliffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s breath became caught. The grove morphed into something she hadn&#39;t seen before. The sensitive coral trees spanned overhead, their branches studded with shimmering orbs of soft. Shimmering plants swayed gently in the currents, their movements entrancing. In the heart of the grove stood a pool, its surface motionless and mirror-like, reflecting the vivid illumination around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s stunning,&#34; Sophia said, her voice barely a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s effective,&#34; Arin clarified, her tone respectful. &#34;The woodland is older than Aquaria itself. It is where the purest magic runs, uncontaminated by the palms of rulers or warriors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned to face her. &#34;Why convey me right here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s visage relaxed, and the sharp edges of her usual demeanor faded. &#34;Because you want to recognize what you are. &#34;What you are becoming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia scowled, her chest squeezing with uncertainty. &#34;And what exactly am I becoming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin approached, her presence authoritative yet somehow reassuring. &#34;You are the bridge, Sophia. Between worlds and forces. You are the key to repairing what is broken. However, you cannot try this unless you grasp the magic that connects us all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin motioned Sophia to accompany her to the pool. The surface shimmered as they neared, with tiny ripples spreading outward as if greeting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a seat,&#34; Arin said, lowering herself to the pool&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia paused before mimicking her. The water felt cool on her skin, yet it hummed with an electricity that made her nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now?&#34; Sophia inquired, staring at Arin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Close your eyes,&#34; Arin instructed. &#34;allow the magic guide you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia moaned but obeyed. As she closed her eyes, the noises of the grove became louder-the delicate rustle of coral leaves, the faint buzz of the water, and the distant music of the ocean. Slowly, the strain in her shoulders relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Experience it,&#34; Arin said, his voice low and calming. &#34;The magic isn&#39;t releasing you, Sophia. It is a part of you. &#34;Let it in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia concentrated on her breathing, following the constant rhythm of the water surrounding her. Initially, there was nothing. Then, like a faint whisper at the edge of her focus, she felt it: a slow and methodical pulse, similar to a heartbeat. It was not hers. It was not Arin&#39;s. It transformed into the grove itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sensation intensified and spread throughout her body, she exhaled sharply. She felt weightless, like if she were floating within the contemporary day of something massive and everlasting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Desirable,&#34; Arin remarked, her voice drawing Sophia back to the present. &#34;Now open your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia followed instructions, and the sight in front of her took her breath away. The pool had altered. Its surface was no longer clear, but swirled with colors-deep blues, colorful vegetables, and glittering gold. Shapes began to form in the water: changing styles, illuminating runes, short snapshots of creatures she couldn&#39;t identify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;what&#39;s this?&#34; Sophia muttered, unable to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The sea&#39;s reminiscence,&#34; Arin explained. &#34;Everything that has ever happened beneath the waves is here.&#34; Every achievement, grief, and mystery. And now it&#39;s yours to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia reached out impulsively, brushing the pool&#39;s surface. The water rippled, and a fresh snapshot appeared-a figure she recognized immediately. Herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood in the center of the mirrored image Chamber, her markings as brilliant as ever. There were three figures around her: Tharros, Kael, and Arin. Their strength swirled together, generating a barrier of light that pushed back a shadow so dark that it appeared to swallow the ocean around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s breath tightened. &#34;what is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The future,&#34; Arin said softly. &#34;Or one model of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia pulled her hand lower back, her heart pounding. &#34;I do not comprehend. How do I know this is real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t,&#34; Arin said, her tone recalling the reality. &#34;The future is as fluid as the water. However, currents usually go somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia glanced at the pool, her mind racing. She didn&#39;t want this-the responsibility and the electricity. It became hers regardless of whether she wanted it or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned to her seat after what felt like hours, exhausted. Arin remained silent, looking at her with an unsettling intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you helping me?&#34; Sophia inquired, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin inclined her head, a tiny smile playing over her lips. &#34;because I see myself in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia blinked, astonished at the admission. &#34;What do you suggest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t born into this life,&#34; Arin explained, her expression distant. &#34;I had to fight for my territory in Aquaria. To show that I belonged. You&#39;re doing the same, whether you know it or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia watched her, trying to detect the sarcasm or ridicule she&#39;d come to expect. However, there was none. For the first time, Arin seemed... inclined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Sophia said, her voice subdued but honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s smile expanded, but it didn&#39;t quite reach her eyes. &#34;Do not thank me yet. The most difficult phase still lies ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia scowled, prepared to ask what she meant, but a startling tremor beneath the trees broke her off. The water around them vibrated, and the shimmering plants faded as an eerie silence descended over the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What became that?&#34; Sophia asked, her pulse racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s countenance deepened as her emerald eyes narrowed. &#34;trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tremor returned, stronger than before. Sophia stood, her heart beating as the grove&#39;s calm was replaced by an increasing murmur. Shadows began to emerge from the grove&#39;s rims, their figures flickering like smoke in the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin rose beside her, her arms shimmering with a gentle emerald light. &#34;Live close,&#34; she urged, her voice steady but insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, the weight of her anticipated connection to the power pressing against her chest. Whatever happens, she may have to deal with it. She went towards the shadows alongside Arin, her tattoos beginning to shine again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Weight of the Crown</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stood on the balcony of his apartments, his golden eyes riveted on the vast expanse of Aquaria before him. The metropolis shone softly in the faint light, its bioluminescent buildings pulsing to the steady rhythm of life. But this night, its splendor seemed muted, and its peace tenuous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His palms grasped the railing, anxiousness coursing through his body. The council meeting statement repeated in his mind-Kael&#39;s warning about the hunters, a few factions&#39; rising concern, and, most importantly, Sophia&#39;s simple presence at the center of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open behind him. Tharros talked without making a turn. &#34;I advised you I desired to be on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, here I am,&#34; Arin replied, her voice filled with laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grumbled, but didn&#39;t argue as she approached. The soft rustle of her garments became almost drowned out by the low hum of the currents outside. She paused alongside him, her emerald eyes surveying the cityscape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re brooding,&#34; she noticed, leaning on the railing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now not now, Arin,&#34; he said, his tone harsher than he intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin raised an eyebrow, unconcerned. &#34;You have been like this for days. &#34;Can you explain why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros exhaled softly, his shoulders somewhat relaxed. &#34;It&#39;s nothing you don&#39;t already know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah,&#34; Arin replied, her smirk vanishing. &#34;this is about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not answer, but the flare of emotion in his eyes betrayed him. Arin straightened, and her expression softened in a way that surprised him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re jealous,&#34; she said, not as a tease but as a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stiffened as his grip on the railing tightened. &#34;I am her protector.&#34; It&#39;s my responsibility to secure her safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Responsibility,&#34; Arin murmured, her voice tinged with doubt. &#34;Is that all it&#39;s miles?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros grew to face her, his jaw tightening. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not implying anything,&#34; Arin stated, maintaining his eyes. &#34;But it&#39;s clear you care about her. greater than you care to accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved aside, his quiet speaking for him. He despised how exposed he felt under Arin&#39;s scrutiny, yet there was no sense denying the fact. Sophia had gotten beneath his skin in a way that no one else had, and it was maddening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael feels it too,&#34; Arin added, her tone wary. &#34;So do I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; eyes returned to her, a flash of rage breaking through his placid facade. &#34;I realize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;then you additionally understand this isn&#39;t some thing any of us can manage,&#34; added Arin. &#34;The draw is stronger than anyone thought. However, that doesn&#39;t mean we should let it separate us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved away again, his countenance unreadable. &#34;less difficult said than accomplished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros awoke the next morning to find himself inside the royal education grounds. The large space was usually buzzing with activity, but today it was strangely quiet. Kael appeared there, sparring with a group of younger warriors. His actions have been flowing and unique, a great blend of energy and beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stared for a second, his chest stiffening as he spotted Sophia&#39;s gaze following Kael. She stood on the edge of the arena, her countenance a mix of awe and curiosity. Tharros felt a primitive desire that he battled to conceal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael noticed him and waived the establishment off, striding forward with his typical confidence. &#34;You&#39;re up early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;needed a distraction,&#34; Tharros replied, his tone neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael smirked as he wiped sweat off his brow. &#34;I didn&#39;t take you for the jealous type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; gaze narrowed. &#34;cautious, Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just pronouncing,&#34; Kael explained, his smirk fading somewhat. &#34;It&#39;s not a competition. &#34;We are on the same page.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we?&#34; Tharros requested, his voice low yet charged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s expression hardened, as his lighthearted disposition gave way to something more extreme. &#34;You are the only one who said the prophecy is greater than us. Do not let your enjoyment get in the way of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros said nothing, his gaze shifting quickly to Sophia. Her giggle could be heard throughout the area as she spoke to one of the younger warriors. It transformed into a sound that both calmed and unsettled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael followed his eyes and moaned. &#34;She is no longer a prize, Tharros. She is a person. And right now, she needs us to be aware of what&#39;s coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded grudgingly, his fists loosening. &#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I am,&#34; Kael said with a smile that didn&#39;t quite reach his eyes. &#34;Now, in case you&#39;ll excuse me, i have greater bruises to hand out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day was a flurry of meetings and preparations. The threat of the hunters grew progressively larger, and the council became increasingly concerned. Tharros barely had time to breathe, but his mind kept going back to Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening approached, he sought her out. He saw her in the mirrored image Chamber, her fingertips glowing faintly as she practiced regulating the currents. She didn&#39;t notice him at first, her attention was completely focused on the water flowing around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re enhancing,&#34; he murmured, breaking the pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia started, the sparkling water evaporating as she approached him. &#34;How lengthy have you been standing there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Long enough,&#34; he murmured, edging closer. &#34;You&#39;re getting better at this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael&#39;s been helping me,&#34; she said, moving a strand of hair away from her face. &#34;He&#39;s a very good instructor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, his face inscrutable. &#34;he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia bent her head to analyze him. &#34;Is everything okay?&#34; &#34;You seem... stressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros hesitated, his thoughts whirling. He wanted to tell her the truth and let her know how much she meant to him. But he couldn&#39;t. Now, not but.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not anything,&#34; he finally said. &#34;simply the burden of the crown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia frowned, but did not press. Alternatively, she moved closer, her presence both reassuring and disarming. &#34;You don&#39;t have to carry it by myself, .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros looked at her, his golden eyes softening. &#34;It is my obligation. &#34;My burden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia said, &#34;Perhaps,&#34; her voice soft. &#34;however that doesn&#39;t suggest you may&#39;t allow others assist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit a chord deep within him, and for a little moment, he allowed himself to believe that she was correct. However, the moment was short, and the barriers he&#39;d built around himself dispersed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get some rest,&#34; he murmured, stepping back. &#34;day after today will be another lengthy day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, but her gaze remained on his as he departed. Tharros breathed as the door closed behind him, and the weight on his chest became heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Tharros stood on the balcony again, the town silent beneath him. He couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the prophecy and the tug he felt for Sophia, Aquaria&#39;s delicate team spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle knock interrupted his thoughts. He grew into Kael status inside the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;what&#39;s it now?&#34; Tharros inquired, his tone weary.</p>
