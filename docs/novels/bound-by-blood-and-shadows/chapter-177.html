                <p>&#34;Are we still leaving today? Has George marked the Vampire? Is that why he is this way? What is going on?&#34; Aunt Alice had never seemed so worried before. &#34;I am so worried that we will be leaving you here.&#34; She cupped her face between her palms, her movement slightly trembling, as tears welled up in her eyes. &#34;Are you certain you will be alright? This castle promises insanity. My daughter-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama, listen to me carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, noting the seriousness in Zezi&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will leave today, no matter what happens. You must.&#34; Then she pulled out a small bottle from within her dress. &#34;I was supposed to give this to George but he is unstable, you will have to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Volakys Extract. It is the only thing that can kill them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice gasped, her hand slipping to cover her mouth and seal the sound away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have time. Alpha Gery is dead and Luna Sky is dead too, so I have heard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find someone to give this to, Mama.&#34; She slipped it into her mother&#39;s hands. &#34;And hide it very well. It is our only hope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know who can help.&#34; She finally said, and tucked the small bottle away within her dress. Then she pulled Zezi in for an embrace for the last time. She had accepted the defeat of never bringing her along with them, or the fact that she would never end up with George. She only ever wanted what was best for her daughter after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Baby. I wish you wouldn&#39;t have to do this alone.&#34; Aunt Alice said in reference to her pregnancy. &#34;I wish I could be there for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not be doing it alone.&#34; She pulled away, stopping herself from crying. &#34;We don&#39;t have much time. You must leave now. I love you, Mama. Take good care of my Mira for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira wasn&#39;t supposed to go with them, but after discovering that Delice was her mother and that she wanted to leave with them, Valerick had allowed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was uncertain if he would still allow it now that Delice was missing, but Zezi didn&#39;t want to deliberate on that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was to change his mind, she needed them to be gone by then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will. Till we meet again, my Baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left the castle but they never made it past the cave that led to the outside of Lavida.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Princess awaited them at the mouth of the cave, with guards behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like an ambush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t leave the castle without a check.&#34; She had declared, when she threw the carriage door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sharp, red eyes filled with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King didn&#39;t subject us to that.&#34; Aunt Alice declared, her voice a little shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who gave you the audacity to question me, you filthy dog!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s hand shot forward and she yanked her out of the carriage, tossing her to the ground. Mira screamed, launching at the Princess and she tossed her away like a pesky fly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George had been put to sleep and he laid in the carriage, of no use to defend them against this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only person in the carriage besides George was the rider and he certainly wasn&#39;t on the side of a fur creature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defenseless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like an ambush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t hurt her!&#34; Aunt Alice yelled as she tried to get off the ground and crawl to Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the Princess wasn&#39;t done with Mira, she went to her, and crouched next to her as the child&#39;s eyes shot daggers at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are nothing like your mother, you stink of the stain you were born from. By the time I am done, you will be gone and everything will be as it should.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get away from her!&#34; Aunt Alice cried, trying her best to shove the Princess away as she shielded Mira with her body. &#34;Leave us alone. We have done nothing to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Princess stood up, madness blazing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Search them! Search the carriage! Search everywhere!&#34; She yelled to the guards who got into action immediately. &#34;One of them has the extract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice&#39;s heart dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was an ambush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty! Traitors!&#34; The Princess&#39;s voice rang loud and clear the minute she entered the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards had dragged Aunt Alice in, along with Mira and an unconscious George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s eyes widened and rage spilled through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you gone mad, Princess? Let my family go.&#34; She yelled, walking over to a guard that held Aunt Alice hostage while sending daggers to the one holding Mira. Aunt Alice looked battered. &#34;I will have your head for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura smiled. &#34;No, I will have your head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on here?&#34; Valerick&#39;s voice thundered as walked to them. &#34;Explain yourself sister before I deem the Execution Ground worthy of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are traitors, your Majesty. They have the Extract!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Extract is in the lab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, they have another!&#34; She held the bottle up in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are we supposed to know that you didn&#39;t plant it there?&#34; Zezi attacked. &#34;You hate my people!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s shoulders tensed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you were so sincere, you would have carried out the search here but you had to ambush my family because you had a dirty trick up your sleeves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very funny, &#34;Queen&#34;. But I saw you in that Room of Statue. Come up with a better lie. I know you met up with Akeem, you are probably responsible for Delice&#39;s disappearance! What have you done with her? What have you done with my friend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your accusation-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true?&#34; Valerick&#39;s voice silenced them. &#34;Was the Extract from you, Zezi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her back stiffened and she refused to turn. Of course, the bond between them was nothing but a snitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could feel it, no matter how hard she was hiding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fucking snitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at me and tell me the truth!&#34; He was using that voice again but she refused to look, to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced and no matter how hard she tried to control it, the bond kept no secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring the wolves to the Execution Ground. They will stand trial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO! Please, no! Valerick, I did it! I forced her to take the Extract with her. I- it was all me. Blame me. Take me to the Execution Ground, but bring Laura around. I stole the extract from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you think I will believe a word you are saying, then you are a fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she called his name, he didn&#39;t turn to look at her, but the anger he felt slipped through her veins, and the bond they shared felt bitter with it. It was so heavy, or ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Throw her in the dungeon, and Laura, destroy the extracts. I want it all gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s screams to be listened to fell on deaf ears and she got dragged away to the dungeon along with her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>179 - Prisoner, Oh Prisoner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dungeon wasn&#39;t a fun place to be, especially for her injured Mama and scared Mira. George was still unconscious. For how long would he remain that way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried my best.&#34; Aunt Alice said but Zezi stopped her from saying any more words as she paced back and forth in the caged space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell the King to send a doctor!&#34; She yelled to the guard at the gate once again but he didn&#39;t move. &#34;I am your Queen and you will do as I say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gritted her teeth in frustration, yelling through their bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He surprisingly didn&#39;t close it down as he used to. Maybe he wanted to but he just couldn&#39;t do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Please, Valerick. Please.&#39; She begged through the bond over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damage was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t listen to her or come to her aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret ate at the corners of her heart and guilt threatened to pull her under, but everything she had done she had done for her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now they were here because of her poor planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did this even happen?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop panicking, I will get better.&#34; Aunt Alice said through the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She attacked you with silver and poison underneath her claws.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No poison.&#34; she managed to say from the floor, her voice thinning into a very low whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was poison.&#34; Zezi snapped, slipping her hands through her hair and pulling at the strands. &#34;I know what she is capable of. She poisoned you and that is why you haven&#39;t healed at all. It&#39;s getting worse.&#34; Her voice broke with tears. &#34;I am sorry, Mama. This is all my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will Grandma get better?&#34; Mira asked. &#34;This place is smelly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Valerick, please. My mother is dying, please. Punish only me. Please, please. Let them go. She&#39;s dying! Please!&#34; She begged again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice coughed, blood spilling from her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama!&#34; Mira yelled in panic before her eyes flashed with thirst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Zezi immediately pulled Mira away from Aunt Alice but her hunger was already awakened and her claws dug through Zezi&#39;s hands to get to the weak prey on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of dizziness washed over her and for a moment, Zezi staggered on her feet, her grip slipping from Mira who used that moment of weakness to her advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She escaped from her mother&#39;s grip, her eyes beastly as she circled the dying prey on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, there were two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one by the wall was still unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth watered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Control was still something new for Mira and for a moment, in her flawless plan, Zezi had forgotten about her daughter&#39;s ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira. You will not do this. You are not a killer. You will not hurt Grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Mira seemed nothing like herself and the dizziness that made Zezi&#39;s body weak wasn&#39;t helping at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira attacked once again, this time around Zezi couldn&#39;t fight it and Mira&#39;s fangs dug straight into Aunt Alice&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From none to two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she been so lucky?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura couldn&#39;t believe it. She had gone from having one extract, to having none then having two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolute luck and fate by her side</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, when her brother had told her to destroy the Extract, she had simply stolen it and lied about obeying his orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, that fur creature had come to be of use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, all she needed was Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she paced back and forth in her room, she couldn&#39;t help but wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the argument they had, Laura had rushed back to her room only to discover that the spell she had prepared to find out who had stolen from her was ready. Then she proceeded to use it and it led her straight to Akeem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stupid half-breed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After threatening to put the blame on Delice, he had confessed that he was responsible and had told her that he had given the Extract to the Queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had then told him that he would be forgiven if he would bring Delice to her, but he didn&#39;t seem to be moved by that. Instead, he begged for her to punish him instead and leave his &#34;High Pillar&#34; out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she had lured him with something greater, something she knew he wouldn&#39;t be able to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring her to me and I will fulfill your greatest desire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not know my greatest desire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will make her love you and only you. I am a witch, what can&#39;t I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will bring her to you.&#34; He had said and she had let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should be here by now, but he was nowhere to be found, and slowly, Laura couldn&#39;t help but think that she had been fooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She banged her fists against the mirror in rage, letting them shatter and dig into her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That low life!&#34; Then she turned abruptly to Oliver who stood at the corner of the room, his hands tied to the bed, and his eyes dazed. &#34;I will have his head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice didn&#39;t die that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas had come to their rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had pried Mira off her grandmother and put her to sleep. Then Gwen&#39;s willing hands carried her as she patted her back gently. Without looking at Zezi, she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certainly mad at her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deserved to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people had come to carry George away, he was slowly getting out of it but his wolf was resurfacing quickly and asking for Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was absolutely insane to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice had been taken away too, Nicholas promised that she would be alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to see him.&#34; She said when he pressed his thumb over her wrist, trying to perform some checks to ensure that she was alright. &#34;I need to talk to him, convince him to talk to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were friends, he should be able to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must think I am a magician.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are his friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are his mate. Whatever you can&#39;t do, I certainly can&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop lying!&#34; Her voice trembled with tears. &#34;Please, I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas frowned, taking a step back. A moment of silence settled between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor never liked her, he never hid it either. He must be overjoyed to see her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This environment is unfit for your baby. I will let him know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that said, Nicholas disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some moments later, some guards came to take her away from the dungeon and they led her into a small room in the Castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had a single bed, no windows, and a door that could only be opened from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a prisoner once again but this time around, she had a crime to her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Treason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>180 - The Runaways</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun was bidding the sky farewell and the shadows of the trees grew with the increasing darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like they were being followed. Most especially, it felt like the trees were making a mockery of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hide at will but no, he couldn&#39;t hide from them. Not from this feeling of being followed, of being watched, of being seen, of being chased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem adjusted Delice on his back, not resting for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been running for hours, not to try and find a way out of Lavida, he knew that the Princess might be at the mouth of the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was too risky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying to get to one of the little villages surrounding any of the Province, even being in the Province would be better than being here where the Princess could find him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the Capital was large and he was armed with nothing but himself, and his Sire was unconscious on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, she would have discovered that he had tricked her, by now she would have sent some of her guards to find him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Blood, she had probably lied to the King about his involvement with the Volakys. Maybe she claimed that he and his Sire were responsible for the whole attack. She must have roped the Queen in it too since he had told her that he delivered the Extract to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Blood, this was a mess! There was no way he could go back, there was no one to help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after all the running, he tripped, his tired legs were of no help and he fell to the floor, his Sire hitting the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groaned, his hand finding the bark of a tree to support him, as he tried to go to his Sire and ensure that she was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Delice!&#34; He called out in a harsh whisper and she stirred, her hands slipping up to her face, the first thing she remembered being the slap Laura had delivered to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyelids fluttered open and for a second she looked around blankly before her eyes shone with realization and she jumped to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter-&#34; the words slipped past her lips. &#34;Akeem. Where are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were trees everywhere she turned and the darkness had now taken over the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to be out of Lavida by now with her daughter!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Her voice was low but it didn&#39;t hide the fear she felt. She could still remember that Laura had been upset with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had slapped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t remember what happened after that. She just couldn&#39;t!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?!&#34; She rushed to Akeem, who looked up at her with tears in his eyes. That made her even more afraid. Akeem was never like this. He was strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is my daughter? What did Laura do to my Medallion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; He finally made it to his knees. &#34;Forgive me, Sire. I had to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory came to her in a flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Laura in her room, she had decided to say farewell to Akeem, but she didn&#39;t find him and she spent some time looking for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally did, he had attacked her and knocked her unconscious with an herb he certainly didn&#39;t prepare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage took over Delice&#39;s aura, and her eyes twitched as her fingers turned into claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She sent you.&#34; That wasn&#39;t a question. &#34;How could you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem wasted no time in explaining what really happened and Delice listened for as long as her worry could let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura wanted him to bring her back but Akeem had betrayed her. That answered nothing about her real worry though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about my daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I escaped with you, Sire. I don&#39;t know of any other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice staggered to her feet, running in the direction she believed the Castle should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was insane, it wasn&#39;t anything that Delice didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must consider her daughter as the reason for their fallout. She had faked her death before when the child committed no sin against her besides being born, now that she could attribute a crime to her name, Laura would certainly be capable of more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter, please don&#39;t touch my daughter.&#34; She muttered as she ran and Akeem went after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t go back, Sire,&#34; Akeem called after her but she didn&#39;t listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been useless to her daughter before, she would not be useless to her again. She would bargain away her life just for her daughter to be saved. She would do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She passed through the trees in a blur and didn&#39;t stop until a sinister laugh rented the air and the familiarity in it made her freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting on a tree&#39;s branch, to her right, was Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Princess had a maddening smile on her face, blood drizzled from the corners of her lips and her claws carved letters into the branch of the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you running back to meet me because you have missed me so much?&#34; She asked, getting off the tree effortlessly and landing on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice took a step back. &#34;Laura.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not the only one looking for you. The Kings&#39; guards are looking for you too.&#34; The Princess folded her arms across her chest, the red leather jacket she wore glimmering lightly under the moonlight, her serpent-red eyes filled with mischief and contained rage, and her fangs out for blood and anything they could sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If your little plaything had the Extract in his possession, then you certainly had a hand in the attack. In fact, you were probably helping the Queen with her mastermind plan of bringing Lavida to ruins. You were once a dirty dog like them. You have a motive to help the kind you believe you were part of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice smile, a bitter one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are those the lies you told the King?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she could hear more footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right, the King&#39;s guards were searching for her. She feared the wrath of the King if she were to be trialed upon these lies on the Execution Ground but more, she feared for the fate of her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we let his guards find you so you can find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>181 - My Gwen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she even found them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It must have been when she had tortured Akeem, she must have put something on him to make it easy for her to find him. Maybe an herb or one of those many spells she used to play around with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we?&#34; She arched her eyebrow at her as she twirled her hair between her claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice&#39;s eyes darted between the place she could hear the guards coming from, to the one in front of her. She looked away for a second yet again and that was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That second had been enough for another destruction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next time she looked back at Laura, she had Akeem&#39;s head in her hand, snapped off his neck, and his heart in another. His body was limp on the ground, his eyes wide and white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those dead eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice staggered back, her lips trembling as pain coursed through her veins at the sudden loss. Her lips moved to speak his name but her voice betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-why?!&#34; Tears ran down her cheeks. Laura had always been a drastic type but this insanity was something. &#34;He didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told him to bring you to me but he stole you away. He took you from me!&#34; She snapped. &#34;No one takes you from me. Not even your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards were getting closer now but that wasn&#39;t what bothered Delice any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Mira! Not her daughter!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the speed of light, Delice was right in front of her, her fist grabbing Laura&#39;s collars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter! What have you done to my daughter?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura laughed, dryly. &#34;It isn&#39;t what I have done but what I will do. Disobey me again, and others will get punished, just like him.&#34; she gritted the last three words between her teeth, and Delice&#39;s trembling hands slipped away from Laura&#39;s shirt, her gaze falling on Akeem who still laid motionless on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blamed himself for his death in a way she couldn&#39;t even explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she had been a better Sire, he wouldn&#39;t be here. If only she hadn&#39;t ever turned him in the first place!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come home, Mummy. I miss you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stole her attention to Laura once again. With the blood stains blending into her red jacket and clashing against the white of her shirt, Laura had her arms spread wide for an embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs moved on their own accord, shock and guilt still filling her veins, she fell into Laura&#39;s embrace, forcefully putting her arms around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura sighed with relief and giggled happily. &#34;I have missed you so much, Mummy. Have you missed me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; The word was heavy, it tasted like sand. &#34;I have missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go home. We will bring him along, we will make a Volaky out of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had received no visitors for a while, except Gwen and Nicholas - who always paid her a visit every now and then to ensure that her baby was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen always brought her food and if she asked, she would tell her about the state of the castle, about how her daughter was safe and enjoying the company of her little bats, how her mother was recovering, and how Mira&#39;s father was still in confinement because he wanted to seek out Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about the King?&#34; She would normally ask and Gwen would be able to provide very little but she would tell her about the state of the castle, how the Lords were against her and saw her unfit to be Queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if they had ever seen her as anything else except unfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They think you are behind the attack, and you connived with Akeem. They believe Lady Delice tried to rat you out and you have something to do with her disappearance. The Princess is the head of the Rebellion against you and she is demanding for you to be questioned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s fists tightened by her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of game was Laura playing? She was certainly doing this because she knew she couldn&#39;t tell the truth or she would end up like Riza, she was backing her up against a wall, finding fun in her misery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was doing more than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was distracting Valerick from her until they would launch their coup in the Castle. It must be getting closer and closer to the time for them to launch their attack, and by the Moon, she had been nothing but a distraction!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when she tried to go against them, her actions had indirectly helped the White Circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sprung up to her feet, slamming her fist against the wall and leaving a dent in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wall was strong though and she felt the ache in her hand twice as painful as it would normally feel. Dizziness swayed her and she staggered on her feet, almost slipping to the ground, but Gwen had helped and somehow she found herself sitting back on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should rest,&#34; Gwen said, offering her a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to talk to him.&#34; She looked up at Gwen with tears in her eyes. &#34;Tell him that I want to see him. It has been days, I just have to speak to him. He has to listen to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty is very busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drink your water, Milady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi eyed the glass and took it from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have told me how everyone is in the Castle and what everyone thinks of me. What do you think of me, Gwen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen looked away, wiping her hand on her apron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My opinions do not matter, Milady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They do to me. Certainly, you must hate me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met her eyes then, those eyes that were always filled with happiness and positivity lacked them totally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel betrayed. I begged you to give us a chance, and it felt like you did, but now, it felt like you never did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it is in you I believe. You may be guilty of this but there must be more to this story than we are being told.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi opened her mouth to speak but her words failed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears glimmered in Gwen&#39;s eyes and Zezi tried to reach her, half expecting her to take a step back in recoil but she stayed there and let her wipe her tears away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if there isn&#39;t more, then I understand and I guess that is what makes me angry the most! That I am on your side no matter what. I remain your Gwen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Gwen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen hugged her and they wept as she promised her that she wouldn&#39;t let her do this alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will be happy again, Milady, I promise you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so sorry, Gwen. Please, forgive me for letting you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright,&#34; she patted her back gently. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>182 - Ripping Union</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days passed and still Valerick had refused to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi drew tally marks on the walls with her claws to keep track of time, and since Nicholas had told her that worrying would only do her baby more harm than good, she had decided to focus more on the fun activities that Gwen had bought for her on her visits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stories her bats had written to her, kept her entertained too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door pushed open and Zezi picked up her empty bowl of food to impress Gwen that she finished the soup, but the feeling that sizzled beneath her skin confirmed that wasn&#39;t Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of rain that flooded her nostrils didn&#39;t help either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile dropped and she set the bowl back on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned to look at him, tears glistened in her eyes even though she was trying to appear strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twelve days.&#34; Those were the words that slipped passed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick looked nothing like himself, but a version of him that seemed to be going through hell and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His loose black robes seemed to sweep the light out of the room, his eyes were as cold as ice, and he seemed tired of being in her presence already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze swept over her and he looked away, trying to pretend not to notice her tired eyes, her noticeable baby bump that shouldn&#39;t be there for how young her pregnancy was, and the fact that she looked leaner than he had ever seen her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pregnancy was taking a toll on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soul seizer had never been born before, they had only ever been made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time his kind would be born and despite everything Zezi had done, he was worried for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made him angry, so angry that he couldn&#39;t think!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nicholas told me that the boy drains you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boy?&#34; Zezi smiled, her hands rubbing her bump. &#34;We are having a boy? That is wonderful. He will be just like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick frowned. He had always wanted a family of his own and he had dreamt of different ways he would go about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had ruined that dream for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nicholas said I will probably have him by the end of this month because this is different from normal pregnancy experience. He feeds on my soul but that is no problem. I can handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was so far away and she was so scared that she would not make it, because she felt weaker and weaker every day. It felt like the end of the month was so far away.  But that wasn&#39;t something she wanted to tell anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so terrified, carrying their baby and he was so far away, by that wall, mad at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deserved to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And a girl. She is the peaceful one, so he said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twins?!&#34; She declared in surprise before she laughed and leaned her head against the bed. &#34;No wonder my stomach is so big.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have come to give you a little ease. He said it will be easier if we remain in the same space for a while.&#34; She heard him move around the room, closer to her and her body went rigid. &#34;My mother&#39;s paintings, it should help. Anything that makes us feel connected should make it feel less like a burden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to look at the paintings he put on her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked him to show her those paintings and she wished the situation had been different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It reminded her of the first time she had learnt his name, and regret sliced through her heart once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My babies are not burdens.&#34; She stood up, her hands on her stomach. He only chuckled in response like that was the most ridiculous thing he had ever heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So ridiculous it didn&#39;t even deserve a proper laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a dry one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he started to move towards the door but she reached out for him, holding his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sparks were crazy but beyond that was the relief. It felt like a million burdens had been lifted off her shoulders and she wanted to hold him forever but the way he looked at their point of contact with disgust made her pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least,&#34; she was breathing heavily even though all she did was stand up and hold his hand. With how heavy she was though, it was a herculean task, &#34;Listen to me, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should count yourself lucky that I haven&#39;t erased you as my people clamour for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erase? I am your mate, don&#39;t you think I deserve to speak my own side of the story before you crucify me? Your sister-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deserve?&#34; He didn&#39;t raise his voice, but he didn&#39;t need to. &#34;You deserve nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take my name out of your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Va-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know about the poison! That is the problem. I forgave you and I gave us a new chance and you ruined it, yet again. Over and over again. You ruin us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s heart dropped, and so did her gaze. Her breathing became rapid and all she could play in her mind was all the times she had thought to herself that he knew, and then dismissed it when he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, he did know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this while?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made her feel even more terrible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not what it seems, I promise there is more. You just have to trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are asking for too much. You had many chances, if there were more, you would have told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After everything we have been through together, you still worked with the Rebellion against me. You are supposed to be my Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was trying to save my people. You are misunderstanding this, but I cannot tell you and you just need to trust me and do as I say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do as you say? I am not your fool. I am no one&#39;s fool! I am King!&#34; His eyes changed in a flash into complete blackness and those black webs spread beneath his skin, covering his neck and then up his face. &#34;And you are no longer my Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s mouth felt heavy, that burden was returning to her shoulders once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fear not the clamor of my council. You are my prisoner, only mine to punish. Once the babies are born, I shall free you from the shackles of this union. You will leave Lavida for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi shook her head, tears pouring down her cheeks. &#34;No. No, please. Please, don&#39;t do this to me. Punish me any other way but don&#39;t separate me from my children. Please-&#34; But he didn&#39;t stop, he didn&#39;t even look at her and the bond between them twisted with pain and agony. &#34;I Love you!&#34; She screamed when his hand held the doorknob, before it was pulled open from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you,&#34; she repeated when he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had longed to hear those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved to go after him, before the door would be closed, but a wave of dizziness hit her, along with the trickle of something warm down her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced with panic as she slipped to the floor, and screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;VALERICK! Our Babies!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>183 - Costly Solutions</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind?!&#34; Nicholas&#39; angry words clashed against the walls of his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are speaking to your King!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas&#39; stance flattered slightly. &#34;You hurt my patient, Your Majesty. You knew about the critical condition she was in and you upset her. My prescription was for you to give her some ease and not put her in a worse state.&#34; He ended, his hands trembling slightly in the pockets of his scrubs, with anger and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas had never taken a liking to Zezi, knowing that she had willingly poisoned his best friend and pretended that all was well, using more manipulative methods to get to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the poison had been useless, it still angered Nicholas the night he had discovered it and he had advised Valerick to be done with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is obvious that she will never come to terms with loving you. Even if she ever does, she will always pick her people over you. That is the most dangerous type of mate to ever have. You do not want her as your Queen.&#34; He had advised him, only for a Joining Ceremony to be celebrated between them some days later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that Valerick was bent on them working out and that made Nicholas despise her even more. Maybe because she had the luxury of something that he would never have and yet, she wasn&#39;t making the bext use of it. Maybe it was because fate was on their side but wasn&#39;t on his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he could be half as lucky as they were, things would be different between him and Irysi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe that was why he didn&#39;t like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he knew of Valerick&#39;s dream of having a family and he knew that he would forever hate himself if he was the one to ruin it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King had to get himself together or he would regret his actions when his anger eventually evaporates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two stupid fools with Fate on their side!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, be careful next time.&#34; Nicholas&#39; attention was on the King who was seated at the opposite side of his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick had a frown on his face and his rage was evident, but slowly that anger dissipated. Nicholas couldn&#39;t see his eyes though and the emotions he felt were concealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Report.&#34; He demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The babies are safe, Your Majesty. They are alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she?&#34; His voice sounded broken for just a moment. &#34;How is my mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That told Nicholas all he needed to know and guided him on his next action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stable for now. If you hurt her again, I won&#39;t let you see her until she has her babies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick scoffed at the challenge and he rose to his feet, his eyes dark with anger. &#34;You cannot stop me from seeing my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas stood firm. &#34;I will not let you kill her, Valerick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas stumbled away, leaving Valerick alone in the office. Valerick stepped out after a while and then went to Zezi&#39;s ward. The sound of her faint breathing filled his ears, along with that of the slow rhythm of her heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was lying there on the bed, her eyes shut and her skin, pale. The way she had been screaming when she saw the blood drip down her legs played again in his mind. The fear she felt as it consumed their bond still had its lingering effects that he just couldn&#39;t get rid of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Including the sense of deep betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was torn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went on his knees by her side, threading his fingers through her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her touch felt like home and he missed her so much, his heart ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mother of his coming bats, his Queen and he had almost killed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HOW COULD HE?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart was broken and because of that, he had almost wiped out his family with his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched a fist against his chest and he wept, while the other held her hand as lightly as his pain could allow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do this to me? I love you, I love you so much, Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart was broken, ripped apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he felt nothing then he wouldn&#39;t hurt her. By feeling no pain from the heartbreak she was putting him through, by feeling nothing, he would be able to help her with his presence, and she would have the babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everybody would be safe if he felt nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry. Forgive me for hurting you, for hurting our babies. I&#39;m so sorry, father is sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only this feeling could be taken away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He missed her so much it hurt, he loved her so much, the betrayal made it feel like hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything hurt!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a thousand claws were ripping at his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just wanted it all to go away but it seemed like it never would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was scared he would hurt her again. Terrified that this time, he might actually kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed this feeling to be gone, and as he listened to the sound of her faint breathing, he realized just what he had to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If his heart was frozen, he would feel nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this heartache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this hatred that was starting to consume him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this pain he didn&#39;t know what to do with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not this overwhelming feeling of missing her so much that it hurt to the point that it reminded him of why he distanced himself in the first place, which always led to anger and so much sadness that he couldn&#39;t fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was consumed by too much, the best solution would be to feel nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing he would never hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frozen heart feels nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what he had to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would freeze his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was even possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting time, he sent a message to Lord Rosil, the greatest witch he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a summon that she couldn&#39;t disobey and by nightfall, the Castle held her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>184 - The Other Side Of The Castle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice would give anything to never hear that voice ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The keys jingled as one turned in the keyhole and Laura stepped in, the sound of her boots muffled against the red rug. Delice could see how the light from the candles hung on the wall, reflected on the surface of Laura&#39;s black polished boots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been? Have you missed me, Mummy?&#34; Laura asked with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missed her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been held as a prisoner in this room, her hands chained to either side of the walls for some time now that she had lost count. These chains were not what kept her here though. It was the threat that hung over her daughter&#39;s head that kept her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mental imprisonment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura.&#34; Her lips trembled lightly. Pale as they were, their colour was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy?&#34; Laura crouched next to her, while she opened a sachet of blood and placed it against her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daug-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drink first.&#34; The words carried a silent warning - Don&#39;t annoy me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Delice gulped down the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is fine. You bear all the blame now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see, since your disappearance, it was easier to convince the King that you and the Queen had planned a revolution against him. At least, that way your daughter doesn&#39;t have to visit the Execution Ground. And since you forever will be with me till he is taken care of, it is best to keep things the way they are right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice blinked, sadness gaining residence in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be sad. I know you love my brother but like I always tell you, this is the best way to love him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was not what she was concerned about right now, nor was it what occupied her mind any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I no longer care about the best way to love the King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not love the King! It was never love, you knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura scoffed like she was being a stubborn child. &#34;So you love who? The wolf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ka&#39;ik.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did feel something for him but calling it love would be going overboard. She just hoped that he was taking care of their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not the wolf. Your,&#34; she chuckled, and a glimmer of madness flashed in her eyes, her claws protruding slightly. &#34;What is that disgusting name you call her? Oh! Your Medallion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do all I do for my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone you barely even know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura leaned closer to her until there was barely any space between their faces, all the humor from her features had been wiped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I. Hate. Your. Daughter. This is all her fault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you hurt her, you are going to lose your Mummy.&#34; Delice attacked and Laura didn&#39;t take that well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would you know?&#34; She leaned back a little. &#34;Maybe she is dead right now and I am just lying to you. You didn&#39;t figure it out ten years ago, it wouldn&#39;t be so different now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice gnashed her teeth, rushing towards her and Laura smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are mad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was right about her. How could she have been so blind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their relationship had always been toxic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It should have never been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is a lock of your daughter&#39;s hair. Can you figure out if she is alive or dead? Or should I bring something else? A toe? A finger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice&#39;s eyes bulged with fear. She rushed to the floor, sniffing madly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said what should I bring next?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She was crying now. She broke free from the chains and held the strands of hair as she wept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t figure out if the child was alive or dead through this. It wasn&#39;t working!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura burst into laughter and Delice stilled as the tears continued to roll down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The &#34;dirt&#34; is alright for now.&#34; She slipped her claws into Delice&#39;s hair, forcing her to look at her. &#34;The next time you misbehave though, I will gift you her head full of hair and we&#39;ll make a doll of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! Please! Spare her, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura rolled her eyes, letting her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was messy, she didn&#39;t like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you miss me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Delice nodded vigorously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you too, Mummy. It was so stressful today. Akeem is really doing well as a Volaky and soon enough, we will have enough for the attack. Before the end of this week, Lavida will be ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Delice had stopped listening when she mentioned Akeem and the guilt of his death washed over her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A kick to the stomach!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice bent over in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is your excitement?! Why haven&#39;t you told me that I have done well?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry. It is all my fault. I will be better. I&#39;ll do better.&#34; The words rushed out of her mouth, and she smiled to impress. &#34;Lavida will be ours, you have done great!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura hissed. &#34;It doesn&#39;t sound right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have done well, a perfect thing you have done! No one else could have done it like you! You are the best!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep quiet!&#34; Another kick. &#34;Argh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This felt so annoying for Laura. Delice just wasn&#39;t as she used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I come back, be ready to be my Mummy like you used to. Do it right! I hate those tears.&#34; She hissed, twirling her claws around her ponytail. &#34;You must greet me with a smile and call me your daughter.&#34; She tapped her claws against her lips thoughtfully. &#34;Hmmm. No. Your Medallion. Go ahead. Call me your Medallion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice&#39;s mouth felt heavy and the word tasted like sand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Medallion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura smiled and then turned to leave, only to see that Oliver had been behind her, an audience to all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he pitied Delice but in the next second, that look was gone and he winked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, she left the room and he followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later, Mummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shut the door and they left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Desire anyone else and I might let you have her like Riza. Any other person but my Mummy.&#34; Laura said when they had walked a good distance from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is only you, Raa Queen,&#34; Oliver responded and she picked him, with a smile on her face as she kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my Oli Baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>185 - The Impossible Has Happened</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi woke up after three days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memories of what had happened the past few days flooded her mind and she, once again, cascaded into the feeling of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My babies!&#34; She had declared in worry before Gwen assured her that her babies were alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi observed that she was no longer in the room she had been moved to after they had taken her out of the dungeon but now, she was in Valerick&#39;s chambers. However, he was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was worried about him, something in their bond made it feel like something terrible was about to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t start moving around like that, Your Majesty. The doctor stated that you needed a lot of rest.&#34; Gwen said, throwing her arms around her to restrain her &#34;strenuous&#34; movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was back on the bed with different questions about what had happened in the Castle while she had been unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Gwen&#39;s report, Zezi gathered that everyone was alright and there had been no new attacks. George was doing a little better, although Ka&#39;ik was still in charge. The allegations against her hadn&#39;t changed much and Valerick was taking drastic steps to handle the situation between them so he wouldn&#39;t hurt her and their &#34;bats&#34; again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Zezi sat up in her bed, hoping that she had misheard what Gwen had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He summoned Lord Rosil, My Queen. I heard that the King had gotten his heart frozen. It has never happened before. No one has ever gotten rid of a fated bond before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s hand crawled up to her chest, her breath coming out in rough pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was why the bond felt heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in her eyes and Gwen&#39;s desperate cry for her to remain stable blended into the background of her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly couldn&#39;t hear her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand went over her bump, and she shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, more than ever, she had to be strong or Laura would win. The only person that would have redirected the King with her wise counsel would have been Delice, but she was missing and from what Gwen had said, the Princess was selling the story that Delice was certainly part of the Revolution against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the ring leaders of the dens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was doing that to sway him from searching for her, which meant that Delice was definitely in her captivity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing more painful than to know of a coming doom and be totally helpless against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring me some writing materials, Gwen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make it quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, My Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the room flung open and Delice smiled immediately getting into her role-play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Medallion. How have you been? Tell me all about today. Mummy wants to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura smiled before her smile vanished the next second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will make this real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next thing Delice knew, some guards came into the room, undid her chains, and dragged her to the Meeting Ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trusted ones were there to witness whosoever was going to happen tonight, Oliver being one of those trusted ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Volakys were nowhere in sight but Delice knew they had already been created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was panicking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Laura about to do to her now? Didn&#39;t she act it out well? Had Laura done something to her daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Delice,&#34; Laura said when the guards forced Delice to her knees at the altar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have I done? I will do better. Tell me my crimes and I will amend them! Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is all about to be perfect. You will be my Mummy, truly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice turned to the ball of massive smoke some distance away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She needs a body. The spell said your vessel is a perfect match. Don&#39;t fight it, it will be painless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice&#39;s eyes bulged in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was going to kill her so that her mother would use her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are crazy!&#34; Delice fought against the guards but before she could get any further, magic brought her back to her knees and paralyzed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what we have always wanted. The ambush is tomorrow but my mother needs a body. My two mothers will become one, you are fulfilling your part in attaining this great mission. Your sacrifice will never be forgotten. I love you, Delice.&#34; Laura said as she circled Delice and sprinkled the liquid from a golden goblet on her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she chained her wrist and her ankles on the floor, where an image had been drawn with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice couldn&#39;t scream, she couldn&#39;t move but in her heart, she wept and cursed the day she met Laura. She was saddened about leaving her daughter, saddened about many things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears rolled down her cheeks and Laura wiped them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so sorry, Mummy.&#34; She said then proceeded to wipe her own tears. &#34;This must be done. I will never forget you, my good friend. My mummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I AM NOT YOUR MOTHER!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to tell but she couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura stepped back and started chanting her spells, while her mother joined in. Her voice commanded more power than her daughter&#39;s own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice could feel the cold daggers of death try to yank her soul away. All they needed was for her to die and for Laura&#39;s mother to be an immediate replacement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agony began for Delice, silent agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Laura stopped and silence took over the hall, as the available members of the White Circle turned to look at one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone is betraying us.&#34; The Mother declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started talking over one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That can&#39;t be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riza tried and she is dead-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Many more too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find her before he does.&#34; The Mother&#39;s voice thundered and they fell into silence at once. &#34;Kill her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Laura had gotten to the upper part of the Castle too late and before she found Zezi, Valerick found her first with a letter in his hand containing words written in blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shouldn&#39;t be possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi is dead.&#34;</p>
