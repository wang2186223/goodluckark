                <p>chapter of her life and beginning a new one with Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! I needed to do something. Maybe visit her pack tomorrow and explain to her. I lay down on my bed completely exhausted as I tried to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, the weather decided to be against me tonight. Rain poured heavily and it came with thunderstorms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes and pressed my ears together as I tried to stop the sound from entering my brain and stirring up my haunted memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret filled me. I would have killed Jenny as soon as she arrived. If I had done so, she would not have been able to destroy my relationship. I was a fool, a big one. I always managed to hurt the people I cared about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thunder blast came so loud that I felt it was directed at my window. I closed my eyes and curled my hand into a fist as I tried to block the degrading voice that filled my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a mistake, father,&#34; I apologized, blood dripping from my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A  mistake? You killed someone and you call it a mistake. Do you know what they would do to you if they found out? They will kill you!&#34; My father whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, trying to stop the tears that threatened to flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not know. Besides, he bit me and I did not die. I am a rogue and he is a full wolf. How come I could kill him?&#34; I asked my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you are cursed. You are a mistake!&#34; He shouted slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain bottles around my chest, sending Adrenaline down my body. Did my father just call me a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father! He insulted me. He called me a useless rogue&#34; I shouted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed and bent to my height since he was taller than me. His lips came close to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the record. You are useless and a mistake. All you do is hurt those who care about your disdainful existence. You killed your mother while coming to this world. You are just thirteen and you have killed your best friend, the only one who appreciated your unwanted presence. I should never have had you. I should have let your mother abort you. At least she would be alive and not dead,&#34; he said and raised his head to look at me. His green eyes filled with disgust and disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened up and took two steps backward, my body still trembling at what he just told me. All my life, I had tried my best to satisfy him, but to no avail, and to make matters worse, he never wanted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now go and bring a lighter. Let&#39;s burn this body before anyone sees it,&#34; he ordered, his voice filled with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there staring at him. I wanted him to tell me he was sorry and that he would not do such a thing. Explain to me how my bite could kill a fellow wolf. Instead, he tilted his head asking me to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We burnt his body at night. I stood there watching the fire burn and the only words that could come to me was that I was useless and I hurt the people I loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone&#39;s ringing tone disrupted my thoughts. I opened my eyes to see my knuckles filled with blood and a cracked wall. I have been hitting the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Benedicta. I picked it up and walked toward my wardrobe where I kept my first aid box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, it is me, Benedicta,&#34; she said in a trembling whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. The hybrid has come out again and is lurking around our neighborhood. Merlin is sick like he is shivering, and so am I. Can you come? So that he won&#39;t attack us. Please. I beg you&#34; she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be on my way,&#34; I said and stood up, wrapped the bandage around my hand, and walked toward the car pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0100</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Finn asked, his voice filled with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my ar around my chest &#34;You heard me. Let&#39;s get married&#34; I repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened with shock. Of course, he had not been expecting me to make such a proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you being serious?&#34; He asked, his voice masked with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and walked toward him, pointing a finger at his chest. &#34;Of course I am. I have never been this sure of something&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me for a while and tilted his head to the other side. A mischievous grin shadowed my face. I would show Luca that two can play a game. He did not get to trick me and have a peaceful life ahead of him. It was never going to happen. I would get married to Finn and send men to kill Jenny and him but I would kill Jenny first so that he can soak into the grief of losing a mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you doing this to get back at Luca? Because if that is what you are trying to do, I am not up for your silly game,&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged my lips. &#34;Why are you bringing Luca into this? I want to get married to you and become Luna. It is time I start performing my duty as a Luna. And also I need to assure you that I have gotten over Luca&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can assure me by other means, not marriage. You do not forget someone because you want to get married to them&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is where you are mistaken dear husband, I am getting married to you because you are my mate and an Alpha. An Alpha needs his mate beside him at all times. Except you have someone else in mind?&#34; I asked in a teasing tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pinned me with his gaze &#34;And what does that mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what it means. Maybe you are in love with someone else, and you want to get married to that person,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This way he would want to get married to me to prove me wrong. I would rub it in Bianca&#39;s face when I see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine but on one condition,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in my breath. Why the hell was he giving me a condition? We were normally going to get married. What is the need for terms and conditions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will get married in three days. That way, you don&#39;t get to change your mind,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion filled me. What the hell did he mean by three days? I can&#39;t plan a wedding in three days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Why three days? Who plans a wedding in three days? I have to invite my family and friends from another pack, I need a gown and decorations. Everything can&#39;t happen in three days&#34; I reasoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have enough people to take care of that. Three days or no marriage till I decide&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrows, he was trying to stop the marriage so that he would continue flirting around with his fake cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I will visit my family tomorrow&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;You agree to a three-day wedding?&#34; He asked Uncertain filled his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Yes. Do well to tell Binca about it&#34; I said and walked away before he could say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning came quicker than expected. Maybe because I spent half of the night turning around trying to find sleep and push Luca from my mind whose kisses still clouded my thoughts. I wondered how he would react to such news. Happy or sad. Well given the fact that he was getting married. I am sure we would be happy for one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I woke up, Finn was gone. Maybe he went to tell Bianca that we would be getting married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled out of the bed. Washed my face and put on my yoga pants as I settled to begin my new morning routine. It would be entirely different from the one in the other pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After doing thirty minutes of yoga, I stood up, took my bath, dried my hair, applied my perfect makeup, and put on my blue trousers and blue handless top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked toward the dining table expecting to see everyone except Finn and Binance but to my surprise, they were both seated there. He smiled at me as I said a gesture I found creepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner than later the servants began to serve breakfast. We had bread, meat, and avocado with coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in silence for a while before he broke it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an announcement to make,&#34; he said and everyone stopped eating, dropping their cutlery. I followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged my lips as I  waited for him to announce our engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Attics Pack had called to inform us that there would be no wedding again,&#34; he said and fixed his gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped at this revelation. Why would they cancel the wedding? I thought they wanted it. Could it be that Luca did not know about the wedding or what? Something had to be wrong somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, are you okay?&#34; He asked with faked concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with a smile. &#34;Were the reasons given?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;No, but rumor has it that the groom was not aware of the wedding, and when he discovered. He called off the wedding,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is bullshit how would the Luca call of a wedding like that. Does he know how much Jenny wants him? She would kill for him&#34; Bianca said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrows as I looked at her. &#34;For someone who claimed to be a visitor you seem acquainted with Luca&#39;s resurrected mate. Tell me, Binaca. Is there something I need to know?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would tell you if it-&#34; she began but Finn cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With that being said, I would love to announce to you that Lia and I will be getting married,&#34; he informed, and the table fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0101</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; Binaca asked. She was the first to break the peaceful moment of silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at Finn. &#34;What did you just say?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard as he stared at her. His eyes softened for a moment before he masked it with his usual wall face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me. We would be getting married&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When was this decided?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped my knife restraining myself from stabbing her. In our pack, if you killed someone you would be killed. I am new here, so I don&#39;t know about the laws of this pack, but I am a Royal. The future Luna of this pack killing someone would not amount to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would ask Annabel later. I needed to know if I would be safe or if I should order one of the guards to do the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yesterday&#34; he answered with finality in his voice and went back to his food. It was clear that he was uncomfortable and wanted this discussion to be over. But the bitch refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yesterday? Finn yesterday you were in the library with me and after that you went shopping then you came back looking for her. When did you make such a decision!?&#34; She shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrows and turned to Finn who appeared to be stuck in his food. It was as if he did not know what to say. I thought he said he had a meeting. Wow, so visiting the library was tagged as a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn! I am talking to you!&#34; She shouted again. The servants widened their eyes in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was becoming interesting. &#34;Bianca&#34; Finn&#39;s sister called in a pleading voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she raised her hands in the air signaling her to stop talking. &#34;Stay out of this, Finn, I am talking to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn took a shaky breath and dropped his cutlery. He turned to her with a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Firstly I do not appreciate you shouting at me. You are not my mate or my sister. You are a distant cousin who should know her boundaries. Secondly, when the decision was taken is none of your fucking business. We decided whether you live by it or you go back to the pack where you are coming from, and thirdly, this could be the first and last time you question me in front of everyone. And just so you know the marriage is happening in three days. If you can&#39;t bear to see me and my mate happy, you can get the hell out of the palace&#34; he blurted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell on the table again. Her eyes filled with tears. Finn focused on his food, avoiding her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three what?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t appreciate repeating myself,&#34; he answered curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She excused herself and walked away leaving the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have delivered the message to Dean,&#34; he said after she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Thank you. That was so thoughtful of you&#34; I said with a smile. She said he was disappointed at my reaction and he did not show it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others continued eating, no one tried congratulating me, not even his sister. It was evident that they did not want me in the pack. His sister had been pretending all this while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and walked away. My appetite had disappeared. I called Diana to follow me to my pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to see my son and see Benedicta&#39;s advice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the pack was a silent one. Diana stole glances at me. She must have heard the news about this morning&#39;s quarrel from the servants. Nothing spreads faster than gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we stopped at Benedicta&#39;s house. My heartbeat increased, and beads of sweat surrounded my head even though the air can was on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would be okay, &#34;Diana assured me as she gave my hand a light squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with a smile. To her, breaking the news to Benedicta would be the most disturbing thing, but I did not think so. The most disturbing event would be if Luca or Sabrina was there. They would immediately convince me out of the marriage plot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been angry at Luca all night long only for me to hear that he never knew about the marriage and that he had called it off. It did not take a soothsayer to tell me that it had all been Jenny&#39;s plan and I had made a rash decision out of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at her and told her to wait for me while I talked to her. She nodded with understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked toward the house and knocked on the door. After knocking twice she opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia! Is something wrong? Are you okay?&#34; She asked with concern and filled her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and closed the door behind her. &#34;I came to see Merlin and to also tell you something important,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and whipped her wet hand on her cloth. &#34;Okay. Lexie took Merlin for check up and would soon be back&#34; she said and gestured for me to sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it is about Luca&#39;s wedding they have called it off. When I got the invitation I was so surprised. Unknowing to me. He did not know about it. He was unaware. I knew it, I knew Luca could not just get married to someone like that. He loves you&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank deeper. How would she react if she heard about my wedding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bang on the door started us. She stood up and went to answer it while I sat down. The bang came again. Immediately, she opened the door, and my heart stopped beating. The familiar scent filled the air. I was sure he was the one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Lia is here,&#34; he said and walked past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bent my head in defeat. &#34;Lia, tell me, is not true?&#34; He asked, his voice filled with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is not true?&#34; Benedicta asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me it is not true!&#34; He shouted but I remained silent. &#34;Are you getting married to Finn?&#34; He asked with a trembling voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, too sad to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0102</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t bring myself to look him in the eye. Instead, I kept my gaze fixed on the floor, the silence stretching painfully between us. The air felt thick, and every second felt like a thousand tiny cuts slicing through my resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper, &#34;you&#39;re actually doing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat tightened. The words felt impossible, tangled up with every bit of anger and hurt that had brought me to this moment. I wanted to be strong. I wanted to look him in the eye and say it with conviction, but the truth was, my heart was rebelling. And I wasn&#39;t sure I had it in me to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Luca. I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta gasped softly behind me, her hand going to her mouth. She knew how much I had once loved Luca, how he had been my everything. But she also knew what I had endured-how his loyalty to me had faltered, how he&#39;d left me in a darkness I had barely crawled out of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s face twisted with pain, his fists clenched at his sides. &#34;So, this is revenge?&#34; he asked. &#34;You&#39;re marrying him to hurt me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to scream that it wasn&#39;t, that I had every right to seek my happiness. But my chest felt tight, emotions warring inside me. &#34;It&#39;s not about you, Luca. It&#39;s about me moving forward. Finding my place and my purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer, his intense gaze locked onto mine. &#34;And you think Finn is going to give you that? You think he&#39;s capable of loving you the way you deserve?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, feeling my defenses crumble. &#34;He may not be perfect, but he respects me. He&#39;s willing to stand beside me, not leave me questioning every step of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s jaw tightened, his eyes flashing with anger and sorrow. &#34;I made mistakes, Lia. I know that. But I never stopped loving you, not for a single day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you let Jenny&#39;s schemes come between us? Why didn&#39;t you fight for me?&#34; My voice cracked, the hurt slipping out despite myself. I had tried to bury it, but here it was, surfacing in all its rawness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled slowly, his shoulders dropping as the fire in his eyes softened. &#34;I thought I was protecting you. I thought... keeping you away from the mess Jenny had created was for the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And look where that left us,&#34; I replied, bitterness coloring my tone. &#34;I was ready to fight for us, Luca. I was ready to stand by you, no matter what. But you left me out there, alone, with nothing but broken promises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room felt colder and quieter as if even the walls were absorbing our pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta cleared her throat, her voice was soft but steady. &#34;Maybe it&#39;s best if we all take a moment. Clearly, there&#39;s a lot unresolved here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Luca didn&#39;t back down. He took another step forward, his gaze unwavering. &#34;If you go through with this marriage, Lia, I won&#39;t be able to just watch from the sidelines. I&#39;m telling you now-I won&#39;t give up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced, a storm of emotions swirling within me. I wanted to hate him for everything he had put me through. I wanted to be strong and move forward with my life, just as I had decided. But his words-they stirred something I had buried, a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, he still cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t change what&#39;s already been decided,&#34; I whispered, though even I could hear the doubt in my own voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s gaze softened. &#34;It doesn&#39;t have to be this way, Lia. You don&#39;t have to marry him just to make a point. Come back to me, and we&#39;ll start over. We can fix this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a shaky breath, torn between the past we&#39;d shared and the uncertain future I was creating for myself. Part of me yearned to believe him, to give him one last chance. But the other part, the part that had been scarred and hurt, wasn&#39;t so quick to forgive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door swung open, and Finn strode in, his expression darkening the moment he saw Luca standing close to me. &#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; he demanded, his voice a low, dangerous rumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca straightened, meeting Finn&#39;s glare with equal intensity. &#34;I was just having a conversation with Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s lips twisted into a sneer. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Whatever you think you have with her, it&#39;s over. She&#39;s made her choice. She&#39;s marrying me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes narrowed, defiance flaring within them. &#34;I don&#39;t think you understand. Lia isn&#39;t some possession you can just claim. She has her own mind, and if she chooses to walk away from you, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension between them grew, the two alphas practically vibrating with unspoken aggression. I could feel it in the air-the rivalry, the desire to prove themselves. But I wasn&#39;t some prize to be fought over. I was done being torn between them, a pawn in their power struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; I said, my voice surprisingly calm despite the storm inside me. &#34;Both of you, stop this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned to look at me, each waiting for my next words, as if I held the power to end this feud once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made my choice,&#34; I continued. &#34;Finn and I are getting married. It&#39;s not a decision I took lightly, and it&#39;s not one I&#39;ll change because of unresolved feelings or old wounds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s gaze softened as he reached out, gently taking my hand. &#34;You heard her, Luca. It&#39;s time you accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s jaw clenched, his eyes filled with unshed pain. For a moment, I saw the vulnerability in him-the boy I had once fallen in love with, the boy who had once been my everything. But that boy was gone, replaced by a man who had let me down one too many times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step back, nodding slightly. &#34;If this is really what you want, Lia then I&#39;ll respect your decision.&#34; His voice was barely a whisper, and I knew that surrender had cost him more than he wanted to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned to leave, a part of me wanted to call out, to stop him. But I didn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t. This was the choice I had made, and I had to see it through, even if it meant letting go of the past we had once shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door closed behind him, and the silence that followed was heavy and suffocating. I glanced at Finn, who gave me a reassuring smile, but it did little to ease the ache in my heart. I had chosen a path, one that would lead me away from the man I had once loved. But at that moment, a part of me wondered if I had truly made the right choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0103</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive back to Finn&#39;s pack was tense and silent. Every bump on the road felt like a reminder of the conversation I&#39;d had with Luca. The look in his eyes haunted me, as did the uncertainty that still clawed at my heart. Yet, here I was, making this choice. Choosing Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled up to the grand stone entrance of Finn&#39;s estate, I took a deep breath, steadying myself. We stepped out of the car, and before I could fully gather my thoughts, I turned to Finn, unable to contain my frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you follow me?&#34; I asked the edge in my voice surprising even me. &#34;I don&#39;t remember telling you to tail me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn raised an eyebrow, his expression hardening as he looked at me. &#34;I have to know you&#39;re serious about this, Lia. I&#39;m not about to let myself get played.&#34; His tone was calm but firm, his words hitting a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms, narrowing my gaze at him. &#34;You think I&#39;m playing games?&#34; I shot back, feeling a mix of indignation and something else-something more vulnerable, though I&#39;d never admit it. &#34;If I didn&#39;t want this, I wouldn&#39;t be here. I wouldn&#39;t be doing any of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, the tension on his face momentarily easing. &#34;Maybe. But I need to be sure. And you haven&#39;t exactly made that easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the words left his mouth, I caught a movement out of the corner of my eye. Myles was standing by the main entrance, watching us with a curious yet unreadable expression. I could only imagine what he thought, witnessing us throwing daggers at each other with our eyes. I glanced upward and saw Finn&#39;s sister standing on the balcony, her gaze piercing and calculating as she watched the exchange between Finn and me. A chill ran through me, though I couldn&#39;t tell if it was from the cool evening air or something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s voice brought me back. &#34;I need to be certain, Lia,&#34; he said, his tone softer now. &#34;I can&#39;t afford to get this wrong. Not again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away, staring at the grand archway that led into the house. The doubts I&#39;d buried were surfacing, threatening to pull me under. He didn&#39;t trust me-not completely, anyway. And why would he? Our whole situation was built on fragile ground, held together by decisions I couldn&#39;t quite understand myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I replied, exhaling slowly. &#34;But maybe next time, don&#39;t sneak around and follow me. If you want to know something, ask.&#34; I hesitated, my gaze hardening as I met his eyes again. &#34;And while we&#39;re on the subject, going to the library with your cousin? That&#39;s suspicious. Maybe next time I&#39;d like to tag along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s face went blank, and he didn&#39;t respond. He just held my gaze, his expression as unreadable as ever. After a long, tense silence, he simply turned and walked away, leaving me standing there, the unspoken words between us feeling heavier than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him go, feeling a strange emptiness settle over me. The desire to trust him, to believe in the life I was trying to build here, clashed with the nagging voice in the back of my mind that reminded me of everything we&#39;d both been through. We were bound by necessity, by choices that had already been made, but was that enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked into the house, my gaze drifted around the hall, its grand yet cold beauty somehow mirroring the unease within me. The ache in my heart grew sharper as I thought of my son, the one person who had given my life meaning through all the chaos. Being here, trapped in this confusing situation, away from him-it was more painful than I&#39;d imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to hold my head high as I moved through the house, even though I was painfully aware of the eyes following me, the silent judgment from Finn&#39;s family, his pack, even from Myles and his sister. To them, I was an outsider. A stranger with questionable motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, I&#39;d made my choice. I&#39;d decided to be here, and tomorrow tomorrow I would make sure I saw my son, no matter what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, as I wandered through the vast, empty halls, I found myself drawn to the small parlor at the end of the corridor. The room was quiet and dimly lit, the flickering light of a single candle casting soft shadows on the walls. I sank into the armchair by the window, allowing myself a moment to breathe, to feel the emotions I&#39;d been bottling up all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, imagining my son&#39;s face, his laughter, the warmth of his tiny hands in mine. My chest tightened, a tear slipping down my cheek before I could stop it. I&#39;d missed him more than I could bear, and being here, in this unfamiliar place, made that ache all the more unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft click of a door opening made me look up, and I quickly brushed away the tear. Finn&#39;s sister entered, her expression unreadable as she took a few steps into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, isn&#39;t it?&#34; she asked, her voice cool, yet oddly polite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, studying her carefully. She was beautiful, her features sharp and elegant, with the same piercing eyes as her brother. I could tell she was assessing me, and I met her gaze steadily, refusing to show any hint of vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome,&#34; she said after a pause. &#34;I suppose I should officially greet you, seeing as you&#39;re Finn&#39;s guest.&#34; The way she said it, with a slight hint of hesitation, made me realize she wasn&#39;t quite sure how to define my presence here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I replied, keeping my voice steady. &#34;I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a small, almost reluctant smile. &#34;I hope you find your time here worthwhile,&#34; she said, her words carefully chosen. &#34;Our family isn&#39;t accustomed to outsiders, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed. It takes time to build trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, understanding the unspoken message. She was warning me, in her own way, to tread carefully, to be mindful of the delicate balance in this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; I said quietly, meeting her gaze with as much confidence as I could muster. &#34;I&#39;m not here to disrupt anything. I just want to build a life, a place for myself and&#34; My voice trailed off as I hesitated, not wanting to reveal too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to notice, her eyes softening slightly. &#34;Your son,&#34; she murmured, her tone surprisingly gentle. &#34;I can only imagine how hard it must be to be away from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kindness in her words took me off guard, and for a moment, I felt a flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was someone in this place who understood, who might support me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I whispered, unable to hold back the emotion in my voice. &#34;It&#39;s it&#39;s difficult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, a hint of sympathy in her gaze. &#34;Well, if there&#39;s anything you need, don&#39;t hesitate to ask. And good luck, Lia.&#34; With that, she turned and walked out of the room, leaving me alone once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the closed door, her words echoing in my mind. &#34;Good luck, Lia.&#34; The warmth in her tone had been unexpected, a rare kindness in this cold, unfamiliar world. Maybe, against all odds, I&#39;d find a way to belong here. Maybe, in time, I&#39;d be able to carve out a place where I could feel safe, where I could be myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And tomorrow tomorrow, I would see my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>104</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath as I stood outside Jenny&#39;s door, the soft sound of muffled sobs reaching my ears. My chest tightened. Jenny didn&#39;t cry often. She was the strong one, the one who would always find something sarcastic to say even in the darkest times. But now, hearing her like this, it was as though a cold hand had wrapped around my heart. I pushed the door open gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of her sitting on the edge of her bed, hair falling in wild waves around her face, eyes puffy and red, made my stomach churn. She didn&#39;t even look up when I walked in, just kept staring down at her hands clenched in her lap. It was like the life had been drained out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny?&#34; I said softly, crossing the room to sit beside her. The mattress dipped under my weight, and she finally turned her head, eyes brimming with fresh tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, don&#39;t you?&#34; she whispered, her voice hoarse and broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly. &#34;Yeah. Luca rejected the marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was thick, both of us lost in the implications of those words. Jenny took a shuddering breath and wiped at her face, but it did nothing to hide the anguish etched into her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would he do that?&#34; she asked, her voice cracking. &#34;What reason could he possibly have, Bianca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached out and took her trembling hand in mine. The warmth of her palm felt fragile like it could shatter at any moment. &#34;I don&#39;t know, Jenny. But we have to find out. There&#39;s something we&#39;re not seeing here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded slowly as if each movement took all the energy she had left. Her gaze shifted, searching my face for reassurance, for some sort of stability to cling to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t stop thinking about everything we&#39;ve been through,&#34; she muttered. &#34;I thought we knew where we stood with him, that all of this had a reason.&#34; She let out a bitter laugh, almost a bark. &#34;Turns out I was wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could say you weren&#39;t,&#34; I whispered. The frustration in me bubbled up, pushing against my chest. I needed to tell her the rest, the thing that had been gnawing at me ever since I heard. &#34;And there&#39;s something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, a glimmer of worry flashing in her eyes. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn and Lia,&#34; I said, my throat tightening around the words. &#34;They&#39;re getting married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s eyes widened in shock, the pain momentarily eclipsed by surprise. She shook her head as if trying to make sense of it. &#34;What? Finn and Lia? How-when did this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I admitted, feeling my own disbelief knotting with anger. &#34;But it&#39;s real. I can&#39;t believe it either, Jenny. It feels like everything&#39;s spiraling out of control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back, pressing her palms to her eyes. &#34;We can&#39;t just let this happen,&#34; she said, her voice gaining a thread of strength. &#34;We have to do something about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A determined silence settled over the room. The quiet between us now felt different, heavier with a shared purpose. Jenny dropped her hands from her face and grabbed her phone from the nightstand. I watched as she swiped through her contacts, her fingers moving with new resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to Luca,&#34; she said firmly, meeting my gaze. &#34;Face to face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;We both need answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shaky exhale, Jenny pressed the call button. The phone rang, each chime stretching out like a drumbeat, echoing the thump of my own heart. When his voice came through, muffled but clear, she sat up straighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, we need to meet,&#34; she said, the command in her voice belying the tears that still wet her cheeks. There was a pause as she listened to his response, and I strained to catch the tone of his voice, but it was impossible to tell from her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight. It can&#39;t wait,&#34; she continued. Another pause. Finally, her shoulders sagged slightly, a small nod signaling his agreement. &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll see you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up and dropped the phone onto the bed with a soft thud. For a moment, neither of us said anything, the room steeped in tension, as if holding its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He agreed?&#34; I asked, my voice hushed, afraid of breaking the thin veil of calm she&#39;d managed to weave around herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Jenny confirmed, wiping her eyes one last time. &#34;We&#39;re meeting tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached over, squeezing her hand once more, a silent vow. Whatever came next, we would face it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft creak of the front door pulled my attention away from the window, where the last hints of dusk painted the sky in streaks of purple and orange. Lexie walked in first, her expression cheerful as always, followed by Merlin, who was already mid-sentence, eyes wide with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;and then the doctor said I couldn&#39;t believe it, but there was a whole room full of sunflowers! Can you imagine, right in the middle of the hospital!&#34; Merlin&#39;s voice carried through the room, filled with the kind of wonder only he could muster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but smirk. Merlin always found a way to see the world through a kaleidoscope of curiosity, even in places like hospitals where people were more likely to notice beeping monitors than wildflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta, sitting in the armchair with a book balanced on her knee, looked up with a warm smile that faltered when her gaze landed on me. Her eyes narrowed slightly, not in suspicion but in that knowing way of hers. I barely had time to wonder what she&#39;d say before she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who called, Luca?&#34; she asked, voice laced with the sort of concern that left no room for evasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Jenny,&#34; I replied, exhaling slowly. &#34;She wants to meet tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat of silence followed the air in the room tightening like a coiled spring. Merlin&#39;s chatter had stopped, and even Lexie glanced between us with a frown, the weight of unspoken questions pressing down on everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta set her book aside and leaned forward. &#34;Be careful, Luca,&#34; she said, her tone serious, her eyes searching mine for a hint of reassurance. &#34;Don&#39;t do anything reckless, anything that might hurt you. And remember Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard at the mention of her name, the invisible line I&#39;d been straddling for weeks suddenly sharp and glaring. I gave a small nod. &#34;I know. I&#39;ll be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the words felt hollow as if uttered from behind a mask. Guilt twisted inside me, a constant companion these days. I pushed it down and forced myself to stand, reaching for my keys on the table. The metallic clink cut through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t be long,&#34; I said, aiming for a confidence I didn&#39;t quite feel. Merlin&#39;s gaze followed me, brows drawn together like he wanted to ask more questions, but even he stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s eyes stayed on me as I turned to leave, their warmth underlined by an edge of worry that I carried with me out the door. The cool evening air bit at my skin, the quiet of the street offering no comfort. I climbed into the car, the driver&#39;s seat as familiar as my own shadow, but tonight it felt different-like a threshold I was crossing into something uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started the engine, the low rumble settling into my bones as I gripped the wheel tighter. The faint scent of Lia&#39;s perfume lingered in the fabric of the seat, a bittersweet reminder. I clenched my jaw, pushing the thought away. Tonight wasn&#39;t about Lia or the promises I&#39;d made that felt like knots around my chest. Tonight was about facing Jenny, facing whatever she knew, and hoping I could find a way to navigate through this without sinking deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The road stretched ahead, illuminated by the glow of the streetlamps and the soft wash of headlights passing by. I took a deep breath, feeling the miles spool out beneath me, each one carrying me closer to answers I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted but knew I couldn&#39;t avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s parting words echoed in my mind as I drove: Don&#39;t do anything harmful, Luca. Remember Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the question that kept circling back was simple and sharp-what if facing the truth was already a kind of harm, one that no precaution could prevent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>105</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room felt too small, too suffocating. I paced back and forth, the rhythm of my steps doing nothing to soothe the chaos in my mind. The ticking of the clock on my desk seemed louder than usual, its sharp ticks matching the pounding of my heart. Just as I was about to circle around for the hundredth time, the door creaked open, and Finn stepped inside, his presence filling the room with an air of quiet intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia?&#34; His voice was gentle but probing. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to face him, forcing a smile that felt more like a grimace. &#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s eyebrows shot up, and he folded his arms across his chest. He was always perceptive, too perceptive for his own good. His green eyes searched my face, looking for cracks in the façade I worked so hard to maintain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; he said, a hint of disbelief lacing his words. &#34;Because you&#39;ve been pacing for the last hour like you&#39;re trying to wear a path into the floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a breathless laugh. It was easier to deflect, to mask the discomfort swirling inside me. &#34;It&#39;s just nerves, I suppose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the doorframe, his expression softening. &#34;I still don&#39;t get it, you know. Why do you suddenly want to marry me.&#34; He hesitated as if measuring his next words. &#34;But if it&#39;s what you want, then it&#39;s cool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed again, the sound sharper than I intended. The tension between us was palpable, but there was also an absurdity to it that I couldn&#39;t ignore. &#34;And I don&#39;t understand why your so-called cousin Bianca got so angry when she found out we were getting married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn flinched at the mention of Bianca, and I caught the subtle twitch in his jaw before he smoothed it out. He shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet my gaze. My smile widened, a predatory satisfaction creeping into my expression. He was nervous. Interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to tell me why she&#39;s so upset?&#34; I asked, tilting my head as if I were genuinely curious. &#34;Because I&#39;d love to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard, his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing. &#34;It&#39;s... complicated,&#34; he muttered, the word barely audible. His fingers fidgeted at his sides, a rare crack in his usually composed demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Complicated,&#34; I repeated, savoring the weight of the word. &#34;Well, that makes me even more interested. You know, I&#39;d love to join you and Bianca next time you go to the library. I think it could be... enlightening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s eyes met mine for a fraction of a second, wide with surprise before he dropped them again. The room seemed to hold its breath, the air between us charged with silent tension. Without another word, he turned on his heel and left the room, closing the door behind him with a soft click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him go, a chuckle slipping from my lips as soon as I was alone. This was getting more intriguing by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streetlights cast long, pale shadows as I stood by my car, the night air biting into my skin. I stuffed my hands into my pockets, watching as Jenny&#39;s car pulled up a few feet away. She stepped out, her heels clicking against the asphalt with a sharp, resolute rhythm. Even in the dim light, I could see the determined set of her jaw and the way her eyes flashed as she walked toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; she said, stopping a few feet away. Her voice was firm, a demand masked as a greeting. &#34;Why did you reject the wedding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her, the weight of the question pressing on my chest. How could I explain what I barely understood myself? &#34;Because you didn&#39;t get my consent first,&#34; I said, my voice even. It was a partial truth, one I hoped would be enough to stop this conversation from spiraling out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, a spark of frustration flickering within them. &#34;Well, now you know,&#34; she said, crossing her arms over her chest. &#34;So, the wedding must push through. There&#39;s no reason to delay it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head slowly, the chill of the night seeping into my bones. &#34;No, Jenny. It can&#39;t happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silence fell between us, heavy and suffocating. She tilted her head, a faint sneer curling at the edge of her lips. &#34;Do you have someone else in mind?&#34; she asked, her voice laced with mock amusement, as though daring me to confirm her suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, the question slicing through the layers of my resolve. The truth teetered on the edge of my tongue, dangerous and exposed. After a beat, I spoke, my voice low but clear. &#34;Yes. And you know who it is, so stop pretending, Jenny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, the mask of control slipping for just an instant before she composed herself again. She opened her mouth, ready to lash back, but I didn&#39;t give her the chance. I turned and walked away, the echoes of her stunned silence trailing behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive back to Benedicta&#39;s house was a blur, the darkened streets folding into one another as I replayed the conversation with Jenny in my head. The tension in her voice, the flicker of recognition when I&#39;d said those words-I could still feel it, like an aftershock. But now, more than anything, a singular, fierce determination thrummed through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked in front of Benedicta&#39;s house and killed the engine, the silence heavy in the wake of the car&#39;s soft hum. The porch light was on, casting a warm glow against the night. I stepped out, feeling the gravel crunch beneath my feet, and walked up the steps. Before I could knock, the door opened, revealing Benedicta, her sharp eyes reading my expression in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did it go?&#34; she asked, her voice calm, yet holding an edge of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped inside, the familiar scent of lavender and old books enveloping me. I ran a hand through my hair, the weight of the evening pressing on my shoulders. &#34;It&#39;s done. Jenny knows the wedding isn&#39;t happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched an eyebrow, closing the door behind me. &#34;And what did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried to push for it, told me it had to go on, but I told her no.&#34; My voice was firmer than I expected, and I took a deep breath. &#34;Then she asked if there was someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s gaze softened, the faintest hint of a smile playing on her lips. &#34;And what did you tell her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told her the truth. That there is someone else. Someone she knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes searched mine for a moment, and then she nodded as if she had expected nothing less. &#34;You did what you had to do, Luca. But now what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to see Lia,&#34; I said, the name falling from my lips with a mix of urgency and longing. &#34;I can&#39;t let her marry Finn. I won&#39;t. I love her, Benedicta. And I&#39;m going to fight for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s smile grew, sad but proud. She reached out, placing a hand on my arm. &#34;Then go to her. Don&#39;t let fear or doubts hold you back. If you&#39;re going to fight, fight with everything you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, the tightness in my chest easing slightly at her words. But the road ahead was still uncertain, and I knew this battle would be more complicated than just confronting Lia. It was the weight of unspoken truths, tangled loyalties, and the delicate balance we&#39;d all been trying to maintain for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But none of that mattered now. What mattered was her, and the chance to tell her everything-to make her see that she wasn&#39;t just someone I wanted; she was the only one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back toward the door, I took another deep breath, steeling myself. The night was far from over, but for the first time in what felt like ages, I knew exactly what I had to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>106</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim light in my room cast shadows on the walls, dark reflections of the thoughts swirling inside me. I paced back and forth, each step only fueling the anger that had settled deep in my chest since I&#39;d learned of Finn and Lia&#39;s sudden engagement. The words felt hollow even as I repeated them in my mind, trying to make sense of it all. How could Finn not see this marriage as a trap, a way for others to pull his strings? He was playing right into their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp knock echoed through my room, cutting through the silence and pulling me out of my thoughts. I took a deep breath and opened the door, finding myself face to face with Finn, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; he said softly, his gaze steady but determined. &#34;Can I come in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, but then I stepped aside, nodding. He entered, and before I could even process the shift in the room, he locked the door behind him. The quiet click of the lock was a reminder of how far he was pushing me tonight, but I kept my face impassive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; Finn began, his tone carrying a dismissiveness that felt like a slap. &#34;I know you&#39;re angry about the marriage, but it&#39;s happening. There&#39;s no point in fighting it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tightened as I tried to rein in my temper. Without a word, I turned on my heel, walked to the door, and opened it, gesturing for him to leave. Finn watched me, disappointment flickering in his eyes, but he didn&#39;t try to argue. He simply stepped out, and the silence in the room felt heavier once he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused just outside, glancing over his shoulder. &#34;Meet me at the library at eight. There&#39;s something we need to talk about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a slight nod, not trusting myself to speak. As he walked away, my fingers clenched around the doorknob, my anger simmering just below the surface. The nerve of him-to brush off my concerns as if they were nothing as if I were the one being unreasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, another knock sounded on the door, and I steeled myself for another confrontation. But when I opened it, it was Jenny standing there, her face flushed and tense. She entered without waiting for an invitation, her eyes immediately locking onto mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; I asked, my voice cold. &#34;What&#39;s the outcome of your talk with Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s mouth pressed into a thin line, and she shook her head, her expression hardening. &#34;He won&#39;t marry me. And we both know why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; I whispered, her name bitter on my tongue. Jenny&#39;s mouth twisted into a snarl, and a dark look passed between us. We didn&#39;t need to say it out loud; we both knew that Lia was the reason everything was falling apart. My mind began churning with possibilities, and I clenched my fists, trying to bring some semblance of control to the chaos inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; I said finally, my voice low and steady. &#34;We&#39;ll figure something out. She can&#39;t ruin everything for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive back to my house was longer than usual, each mile stretching on as I replayed my conversation with Jenny in my mind. Her defiance, her frustration-they had all been reminders of the stakes in this tangled mess. It was like being caught in a web where every decision seemed to pull someone deeper into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally pulled up to the house, I was greeted by the familiar scent of lavender drifting from the porch. I stepped inside, relishing the quiet, and made my way to the dimly lit living room. The stillness wrapped around me, comforting and foreboding at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I poured myself a drink, the glass feeling cool against my fingertips as I sat down on the couch. Silence filled the room, thick and heavy, as I stared at the amber liquid swirling in the glass. Thoughts of Lia crept in, vivid and painful. I took a long sip, hoping it would dull the ache, but it only seemed to sharpen it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s wedding to Finn felt like a ticking time bomb, one that would explode and take everything I cared about with it. I couldn&#39;t allow it to happen, not like this. Not when I knew deep down that she didn&#39;t love him-not the way she should love someone she was going to marry. There was something else, something that kept pulling her back, but I couldn&#39;t quite reach it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched the glass tighter, the cold pressing into my palm. There had to be a way out of this-a way to make her see that this marriage wasn&#39;t the answer. I could almost hear Benedicta&#39;s voice in my head, urging me to fight for her, to not let fear or doubt keep me from what mattered most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how? How could I stop her from going through with this when every move I made seemed to push her further away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Images of Lia and Finn together flooded my mind, stirring a surge of anger and jealousy that I struggled to control. My mind flashed back to the last time I&#39;d seen her, the look in her eyes when I&#39;d tried to tell her how I felt. She&#39;d been so closed off, so guarded. And I knew that if I let her slip away now, there would be no second chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to take another drink, hoping it would clear my head, but the thoughts kept coming, relentless and unforgiving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night my mind kept circling back to Lia&#39;s face, the way her eyes softened whenever she thought no one was watching, the quiet determination in her gaze when she was sure of something. And now, she was standing on the edge of a choice that could ruin everything. A choice that would bind her to someone she didn&#39;t truly want, all because of some sense of duty-or fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frustration gnawed at me, eating away at my resolve. I couldn&#39;t let her go through with it. She deserved a life filled with love and passion, not one dictated by family alliances and obligations. But how could I make her see that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walls felt like they were closing in, and the silence only amplified the turmoil inside me. My hand hovered over my phone, the temptation to call her almost overwhelming. But I knew that showing up unannounced, demanding she reconsider, would only push her further away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to be patient, but patience had never felt more impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>107</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Finn had left, I sat alone in the dark, staring into the quiet night outside my window. Every fiber of my being screamed that this wasn&#39;t over-that I couldn&#39;t let it be over. Finn might think he was in control, but I could see the truth: he was slipping through my fingers, drawn to Lia in ways he didn&#39;t even understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark plan began to take shape in my mind, forming slowly, taking root in the anger and resentment festering inside me. If Lia was going to stand between me and the life I deserved, then I would make sure she paid the price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my phone, dialing a familiar number. The line rang once, twice, before a gruff voice answered on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a favor,&#34; I said, my tone laced with cold determination. &#34;And this time, it&#39;s non-negotiable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause, then a low chuckle. &#34;I thought you&#39;d come around. What do you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia. I need you to make her rethink her choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man laughed again, a sound that sent a chill down my spine, even though I&#39;d heard it countless times before. &#34;Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I hung up the phone, a twisted sense of satisfaction filled me. I knew the road ahead was dangerous, that there was no turning back from the path I&#39;d chosen. But I didn&#39;t care. If Lia wanted to ruin my life, I would make sure she suffered just as much-if not more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat there for a few moments longer, the silence of the room pressing in on me. My fingers hovered over the phone again, hesitating. There was one more thing I needed to do-another person I needed to talk to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrolled through my contacts, stopping at the number I was looking for. Her name flashed on the screen, and I took a deep breath before dialing. The phone rang a few times before she picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca?&#34; she said, her voice a mix of curiosity and wariness. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meet me at The Orchid Café in thirty minutes,&#34; I replied, my tone flat, businesslike. &#34;I have something important to discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there,&#34; she said, the line clicking off without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for anything else. I stood up, pacing the room as the minutes passed by, my mind racing. This wasn&#39;t just about Finn anymore-it was about removing any obstacle that stood between me and the life I&#39;d always wanted. Lia had to be eliminated from the equation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Orchid Café wasn&#39;t far from my place. It was quiet and discreet-a perfect location for what I needed to discuss. I grabbed my jacket and quickly left the house, the weight of my plan settling heavily in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the café, the dim lights and the warm aroma of coffee greeted me as I entered. I scanned the room and found her waiting at a corner table. Ava. The one person who could make things happen when you needed something messy to be cleaned up. Her dark hair framed her sharp features, and her eyes narrowed slightly as I approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; she said, her voice tinged with caution as I sat down across from her. &#34;What&#39;s this about? You know I don&#39;t like surprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, leaning forward, my voice low. &#34;And this time, I need you to do something for me. Something... drastic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked on mine. She was a woman of few words, but when she spoke, her words carried weight. &#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the intensity of her gaze, and for a moment, I was reminded of why I always went to her for things like this. Ava had a way of reading people, knowing their deepest fears and desires, and using that to her advantage. She didn&#39;t need to be told twice-she could read between the lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to get rid of someone,&#34; I said, barely above a whisper, but the words cut through the air like a knife. &#34;Her name&#39;s Lia. She&#39;s... in the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava didn&#39;t flinch. She merely raised an eyebrow, folding her arms across her chest. &#34;In the way of what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the way of my future. In the way of everything I&#39;ve worked for.&#34; I leaned in, my hands gripping the edge of the table. &#34;I can&#39;t have her around anymore. Finn... he&#39;s blinded by her. He doesn&#39;t see it, but she&#39;s trying to steal everything from me. And I need her gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava&#39;s eyes darkened slightly, and she nodded slowly. &#34;What do you want me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to pretend to be an event planner. I want you to get close to her. Organize some... kind of event, anything to get her out of her comfort zone. Make her trust you. And once you&#39;ve done that&#34; I paused, my heart beating faster as I pictured it. &#34;You can do whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava&#39;s lips curled into a slight smirk, and there was a cold edge to her voice when she responded. &#34;I like how you think, Bianca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair, feeling the weight of the plan settle in my bones. &#34;You&#39;re the best at what you do, Ava. And once Lia&#39;s out of the picture, Finn won&#39;t have anyone to turn to. He&#39;ll have no choice but to come back to me. Everything will fall into place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava gave me a look that made it clear she was already formulating her next steps. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll be done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a small shiver run down my spine, but it wasn&#39;t fear-it was exhilaration. The pieces of the puzzle were starting to fall into place, and I wasn&#39;t about to stop now. Lia wouldn&#39;t know what hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat in silence for a moment longer before Ava stood, her movements sharp and purposeful. &#34;I&#39;ll contact you once it&#39;s taken care of. You&#39;ll be the first to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, watching her walk away, feeling a twisted satisfaction bloom within me. I had all the pieces I needed now. There was no stopping me. No turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I left the café, the night air felt colder, but I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of anticipation that buzzed in my veins. The game was just beginning. And this time, I would be the one to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>108</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minutes ticked by, each one pulling me closer to a decision I knew I could never take back. My heart pounded as I sat there, gripping the edges of the armchair in Benedicta&#39;s living room. I&#39;d been over it all a hundred times in my head, weighing every word I might say, every possible outcome. But as the minutes passed, it became clear that thinking wasn&#39;t going to get me anywhere. It was time to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a surge of determination, I finally stood up, grabbing my keys from the table. I didn&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;d say, or how I&#39;d stop this wedding, but I knew I had to try. There was no way I could sit back and let Lia marry Finn. Not when I was ready to lay everything on the line for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I opened the door, the cool night air hit my face, and for a moment, it was like a shot of clarity. I could feel a path opening in front of me, even if it was narrow and uncertain. I was done waiting, done standing on the sidelines. I would fight for Lia with everything I had-even if it meant crossing lines I never thought I would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to Finn&#39;s territory felt longer than it had any right to. Each mile seemed to stretch, each turn tightening the knot in my chest. The sky was pitch black, with only the faint glow of streetlights here and there, illuminating the road just enough to guide my way. Finally, I pulled up to the gate of Finn&#39;s pack, the tall iron bars casting long, ominous shadows across the ground. I parked, feeling the weight of everything I wanted to say pressing down on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped out of the car and closed the door quietly, hoping not to draw any immediate attention. For a brief second, I just stood there, gathering my thoughts. Then, reaching into my pocket, I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my contacts until Lia&#39;s name appeared on the screen. I took a deep breath and hit the call button, holding the phone to my ear as it rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each ring felt like an eternity, my pulse thudding in sync with the sound. Just as I thought it might go to voicemail, Lia picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca?&#34; Her voice was soft and cautious, as if she already sensed something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. &#34;I&#39;m at the gate. Please, come out. I need to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, and I could almost feel her glance around, torn between my request and the boundaries she now had to respect. &#34;Luca, I can&#39;t. You know it&#39;s it&#39;s not right for you to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, I noticed movement in the distance. Two guards and a sentinel were making their way toward me, their steps purposeful and their expressions stern. They must have noticed my car and come to check. My grip tightened on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, please,&#34; I said urgently, watching the guards approach. &#34;I&#39;m not here to cause trouble. Just come out for a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; she whispered, her tone strained, &#34;you need to go. If they see you here, it&#39;ll only make things worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards were close now, one of them motioning for me to leave. &#34;Sir, you&#39;re not authorized to be here,&#34; the guard said firmly, crossing his arms as he blocked my view of the gate. &#34;This is private territory. You need to leave immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could still hear Lia on the other end of the line, breathing softly, hesitating. I turned away from the guards, lowering my voice. &#34;Lia, listen to me. I put a stop to my wedding with Jenny. I couldn&#39;t go through with it, not when not when you&#39;re all I think about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was silent, and I could feel the weight of her thoughts as if they were my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, please,&#34; I continued, desperation creeping into my voice. &#34;Do the same, Lia. Don&#39;t marry Finn. If you&#39;re doing this because you thought I was going to be with Jenny, then then don&#39;t. Let&#39;s stop this before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long pause, and then I heard her sigh, a sad, resigned sound. &#34;Luca, I can&#39;t just stop everything now. This is about more than you and me. Finn it would be humiliating for him if I backed out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest tightened at her words. &#34;Humiliating for him? What about us, Lia? Doesn&#39;t that matter to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It does,&#34; she said quietly. &#34;But I went through with this because I thought you&#39;d already made your choice. You can&#39;t blame me for that. You can&#39;t show up here now and ask me to ruin everything I set in motion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a sharp, hollow ache in my chest. &#34;So that&#39;s it?&#34; I asked, barely able to keep the hurt from my voice. &#34;You&#39;d rather protect him than take a chance on us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, please understand,&#34; she said, her voice breaking. &#34;It&#39;s not as simple as that. I have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia-&#34; I started, but she&#39;d already hung up. The line went dead, and I was left standing there, the silence pressing down on me like a weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered the phone from my ear, staring at it in disbelief. My hands were shaking with frustration, with anger, with every emotion I&#39;d tried to keep buried for too long. Before I even realized what I was doing, I hurled the phone onto the ground, watching as it shattered into pieces, the small fragments scattering across the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards were still watching me, wary but silent. I didn&#39;t care. Without another word, I turned, got back into my car, and slammed the door shut. My heart felt like it was being squeezed, a pain I hadn&#39;t expected searing through my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drove away from Finn&#39;s territory, the night felt darker and colder, and I realized that, for the first time, I had no idea where to go from there. I&#39;d put everything on the line and left myself vulnerable, only to have her turn away, unwilling to take the same risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as painful as it was, one thing became clear at that moment: I wasn&#39;t giving up on Lia. Not yet. Not while there was still a chance to make her see what we could be together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>109</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up feeling as though a weight had settled on my chest. The conversation with Luca from the night before replayed in my mind like a haunting melody, filling me with an ache I couldn&#39;t shake. He&#39;d asked me to call off the wedding and pleaded with me to see the future we could have together. And yet, I hadn&#39;t been able to agree, the idea of humiliating Finn and unraveling everything I&#39;d promised myself pushing back against everything Luca had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, pushing away the lingering sadness as I dressed. My heart felt heavy, but I couldn&#39;t let it show. Not today. Finn and his family expected me to play my role, to be the poised fiancée, and I couldn&#39;t afford to slip. After fixing my hair and straightening my clothes, I took one last look in the mirror, steeling myself, and headed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I entered the dining room, I saw that everyone else was already seated. Bianca sat to Finn&#39;s left, her dark eyes narrowing as they landed on me. Next to her, Finn&#39;s sister, Alina, held an equally icy expression. I swallowed, forcing myself to look past the silent hostility in their glares. Whatever issues they had with me, I couldn&#39;t let it unsettle me now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I approached, Finn stood up, smiling warmly. &#34;Lia,&#34; he greeted, pulling out a chair beside him. I sat down, offering him a polite smile as he leaned in and pressed a light kiss to my cheek. The gesture, though gentle, felt hollow, as if he were reminding the others of our bond more than sharing a real moment between us. I could almost feel Bianca&#39;s glare intensify from across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid appeared, laying plates in front of us. The scent of fresh herbs and roasted vegetables filled the room, but I had no appetite. I glanced at Bianca and caught the sneer still lingering on her face, a silent reminder of the invisible wall that had grown between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Finn, I cleared my throat and spoke with a calmness I barely felt. &#34;Finn, I&#39;ve arranged to meet with an event planner today to discuss some ideas for the wedding. Since Bianca isn&#39;t very occupied around the house, I thought it would be nice for her to join me. She could help me pick out a design and theme for the ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s face lit up with approval. &#34;That&#39;s a great idea, Lia. I&#39;m sure Bianca would be happy to lend a hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, I felt a sliver of satisfaction as I looked at Bianca. Her eyes widened in shock, her mouth opening as if she wanted to protest, but she quickly closed it, casting a look of veiled resentment my way instead. She nodded, though it was clear she didn&#39;t want to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; she said coolly, barely hiding the displeasure in her tone. &#34;I&#39;d be honored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The table fell into silence as the maids served our plates, and I focused on the food in front of me, picking at it more than actually eating. Finn reached over, his hand resting gently on mine, his smile kind but slightly oblivious to the tension that crackled in the room. It felt surreal, pretending as though things were perfect when, deep down, I knew nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door creaked open, and one of the sentinels stepped in, his gaze moving respectfully between us. He held something in his hand, his expression cautious as he approached the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; he addressed Finn, holding out a small object. &#34;We found this phone just outside the main gate, lying on the ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, my heart skipped a beat as I recognized the scuffed casing and faint crack on the screen. Luca&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my breath, trying to keep my face neutral, but a flicker of panic gripped me. Finn noticed my reaction, his brow furrowing slightly as he looked down at the phone in the sentinel&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see who left it?&#34; Finn asked his tone a blend of curiosity and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sentinel shook his head. &#34;No, sir. We found it on our morning patrol. It didn&#39;t belong to anyone on our team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s expression grew thoughtful, and he nodded, accepting the phone from the sentinel. &#34;Check the CCTV footage from last night,&#34; he instructed, holding the phone carefully. &#34;And look through the contacts or any identifying information. Let&#39;s find out who this belongs to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sentinel gave a quick nod. &#34;Right away, sir,&#34; he said, taking the phone back and excusing himself from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to look away, breathing carefully as I felt Finn&#39;s gaze shift to me. He looked as though he was about to say something, but his focus was soon diverted by Bianca, who leaned forward, a knowing smirk tugging at the corner of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it strange, Finn?&#34; she mused. &#34;We never have unexpected visitors here. I wonder what sort of person would come all this way just to leave their phone at the gate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists under the table, keeping my expression calm as I glanced at Finn. He was frowning now, looking down at his plate, clearly considering her words. I knew Bianca had her suspicions, and now, with Luca&#39;s phone in the guards&#39; possession, she was all too eager to stir trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t let her. Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably just a mistake,&#34; I said lightly, forcing a small smile. &#34;You know how careless people can be with their phones. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be easy enough to return once the guards have checked it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn looked at me for a moment, his eyes searching my face, and I held his gaze, hoping he wouldn&#39;t see past my calm facade. After a beat, he nodded, his expression relaxing as he squeezed my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not worry about it,&#34; he said finally, looking around the table with a reassuring smile. &#34;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s smile faded as Finn moved on, his focus returning to the meal and the plans we had for the day. Though the unease in my chest remained, I relaxed slightly, relieved that for now, the topic was behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meal continued, Bianca kept her gaze fixed on me, her frustration simmering beneath the surface. I&#39;d have to tread carefully today, not just for myself but to ensure no one discovered what had really happened last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, all I could do was play my part and hope that Luca&#39;s presence at the gate would remain nothing more than a rumor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>110</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into my office, eager for a moment of solitude to collect my thoughts. The events of the day were already enough to make my head spin-Lia&#39;s suggestion to bring Bianca along to the event planner and the strange phone found by the gate. I needed a moment to sort it all out in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I&#39;d barely had time to sit down when the door opened, and Bianca slipped inside, her eyes locked on me with a determined glint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; I said, exasperated, &#34;I need to concentrate. I don&#39;t have time for interruptions right now. Can you please leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t seem the least bit interested in listening. Instead, she walked up to me, her expression softening as she drew closer. She placed one hand on my face, her fingers trailing along my cheek in a way that was both familiar and unsettling. I opened my mouth to protest, but before I could, she leaned in, her lips hovering dangerously close to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; I said, my tone more forceful this time, though I was beginning to feel trapped by her insistence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door swung open, and Lia walked in. She paused, her expression flashing briefly with surprise, but she recovered quickly, her face shifting into calm neutrality. Her gaze darted between Bianca and me, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Finn,&#34; she said, her tone as composed as ever. &#34;I just wanted to let you know I&#39;ll be going out for a bit. I haven&#39;t finished inviting people for the wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, grateful for the interruption and for her ability to mask whatever she&#39;d seen. &#34;All right,&#34; I replied. &#34;Let me know if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she gave a brief nod and turned, leaving us alone again. The moment she was gone, Bianca dropped her hand from my face, her expression hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s odd?&#34; she said, her voice low, her gaze narrowing toward the closed door. &#34;I think Lia knows something about that phone found at the gate. We need to find out who it belongs to and why it&#39;s here. She&#39;s hiding something, Finn-I&#39;m sure of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away from her, already tired of her constant insinuations. &#34;Bianca, don&#39;t start with this again,&#34; I said, my tone dismissive as I sank into my chair. &#34;Lia isn&#39;t a suspect, and I trust her completely. She has nothing to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Bianca just stared at me, her eyes flashing with irritation and disbelief. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re so blind to what&#39;s happening right in front of you,&#34; she muttered, her voice laced with anger. &#34;You&#39;re going to regret this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she spun on her heel and strode out of the office, slamming the door behind her. The echo of her exit lingered in the room, but I pushed it aside, focusing on the calm I desperately needed to maintain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a steadying breath, but I couldn&#39;t shake the unsettling feeling that had crept in. As much as I trusted Lia, the timing of her unexpected visit and the appearance of that phone didn&#39;t sit right with me. Bianca&#39;s accusations were groundless, but I still needed to know if there was any truth lurking beneath her paranoia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s hesitation, I picked up my phone and dialed a number, waiting for the call to connect. When a voice answered on the other end, I kept my tone low and measured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to keep an eye on Lia,&#34; I said, my voice quiet but firm. &#34;I want to know where she&#39;s going and who she meets. Report back with everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I ended the call, hoping that whatever I found would confirm what I already knew: that Lia was trustworthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile spread across my face as I slipped into my car and started the engine. I hadn&#39;t left Finn&#39;s office door right away. Instead, I&#39;d paused, leaning just close enough to listen to the exchange inside, my ear pressed against the heavy wood. What I heard had been worth it: Bianca&#39;s voice, tense and insistent, accusing me of hiding something about the phone found at the gate. Finn had defended me, dismissing her accusations and saying he trusted me completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was gratifying to hear him stand by me, especially when Bianca&#39;s animosity was so obvious. But her suspicion was unnerving, as was her refusal to let it go. Now, I&#39;d have to watch my steps even more carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I pulled out of the driveway and started toward Benedicta&#39;s house, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of urgency. I needed to see Luca, to tell him what had happened, and to warn him about Bianca&#39;s suspicions. I picked up my phone and tried to dial his number, but each call only led to an automated message saying the line was unreachable. Frustration simmered as I hung up, gripping the steering wheel tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, almost instinctively, my thoughts shifted to the phone found near the gate earlier that morning. A sick feeling crept over me as a realization hit: it had to be Luca&#39;s. The timing, his calls going straight to voicemail-it all fits too perfectly. He must have come to see me last night and lost his phone in the process. I could only imagine how he&#39;d felt, being turned away without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; I muttered, hitting the steering wheel in frustration. The unexpected force of my action made my car veer slightly off the road. I tried to correct it, but it was too late; the tires skidded and with a sudden jolt, my car collided with a pole, the impact sending a shudder through my bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34; I groaned, bracing myself as the car finally came to a halt. My heart was racing, the shock of the crash vibrating through me. Thankfully, it hadn&#39;t been too severe, and after a moment, I managed to catch my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the door, I stepped out, brushing a stray lock of hair out of my face. Just as I examined the damage to the front bumper, I noticed another car pulling up behind me. The vehicle parked at an odd distance, far enough to seem cautious, yet close enough to keep me in sight. I watched, the hairs on the back of my neck prickling. This was no random passerby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen that car parked outside Finn&#39;s estate before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steadying breath, I squared my shoulders and walked toward the car. The driver, a tall, nondescript man in a dark jacket, rolled down his window, his expression blank as he looked at me. I raised an eyebrow, folding my arms as I regarded him coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can stop pretending you&#39;re here by accident,&#34; I said, my voice calm but laced with authority. &#34;We both know Finn sent you to follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change, but I caught the slight twitch of his mouth, betraying his discomfort. &#34;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re talking about. I was just passing by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; I said, rolling my eyes. &#34;Let&#39;s not waste time. If Finn wants updates on where I&#39;m going, you can tell him yourself. And while you&#39;re at it, call him and let him know that his driver should come pick up my car. I don&#39;t have time to wait here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man hesitated, clearly torn between following orders and respecting my request. But I wasn&#39;t about to let him wriggle out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make it simple,&#34; I continued, leaning in closer. &#34;You can either make the call and tell Finn&#39;s driver to take care of the car, or you can let him know you lost track of me and deal with his reaction later. Your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed, glancing away as if weighing his options. After a moment, he pulled out his phone, dialing a number while glancing at me from the corner of his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a faint, satisfied smile, then turned on my heel and walked back to the road, leaving him to explain the situation to Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>111</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean her car got damaged?&#34; I barked into the phone, my voice echoing down the hall. I gripped the phone tighter, barely able to keep my frustration in check. The man on the other end was stammering through his words, and every second I had to wait felt like another jab of irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir Lia&#39;s car hit a pole,&#34; he finally managed. &#34;She&#39;s fine, but, uh, she decided to leave in a taxi. She instructed me to call and have one of the drivers come to pick up her car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth, feeling a rush of anger pulsed through me. &#34;So she just left? Without letting anyone know what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; he replied, his voice timid. &#34;She, um, seemed in a hurry and said she&#39;d take care of things herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to say more, but a voice floated in from down the hall, and I turned to see Alina, my sister, standing there, her arms crossed with a smirk already spreading across her face. I ended the call abruptly, not wanting her to hear any more than she already had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that is rich,&#34; Alina laughed, barely able to contain her amusement. &#34;Your precious bride-to-be crashes her car and doesn&#39;t even bother to call you? And instead of you going to her, she just what, sends for a driver to clean up the mess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina,&#34; I warned, already exhausted by her taunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step closer, her laughter still simmering. &#34;Is this really the woman you&#39;re planning to marry, Finn? I mean, if she&#39;s already treating you like her personal cleanup crew, I can only imagine what life will be like for you after the wedding.&#34; Her eyes glinted with mischief, relishing the chance to rattle me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; I shunned her instantly, my voice cold. I didn&#39;t have the patience for this today, least of all from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t back down, the smile never leaving her face. &#34;Fine, fine. But just think about it, dear brother. Some of us can see the mess you&#39;re walking into, even if you can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away, biting back the retort that was on the tip of my tongue. Her laughter followed me as I walked down the hall, my irritation simmering with every step. The last thing I needed was Alina meddling in my business. I didn&#39;t care what she thought of Lia; Alina&#39;s perspective on anyone other than herself had always been skewed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so focused on keeping my composure that I nearly ran into Bianca as she came around the corner. Her eyes widened in surprise, and she reached out, steadying herself against my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn,&#34; she said, concern creasing her brow. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, feeling too frustrated to explain. &#34;Nothing, Bianca. Just don&#39;t worry about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze followed me, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to stop and talk. I needed space to think, to sort through what had just happened without Bianca or Alina picking it apart and making it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I moved away from her and headed toward my office, I forced myself to focus. I would deal with the car, and I would deal with Lia, and no amount of meddling from anyone was going to change that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived at Benedicta&#39;s house, feeling a strange sense of relief wash over me. The morning had been tense, and the drive here, with everything replaying in my mind, had only tightened the knots in my chest. But as I stepped into the cozy warmth of Benedicta&#39;s home, I felt myself begin to relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I walked in, Merlin came bounding over, his face lighting up as soon as he saw me. &#34;Lia!&#34; he called, throwing his small arms around my waist in a fierce hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, scooping him up into my arms. &#34;Merlin, my little knight,&#34; I said, kissing the top of his head. &#34;Have you been keeping the kingdom safe while I&#39;ve been away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He giggled, nodding proudly. &#34;Of course! I made a fort out of the sofa cushions,&#34; he said, his eyes wide with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds like a castle fit for a true knight,&#34; I replied, giving him a squeeze. &#34;Now, go show me how brave you are, and let Benedicta and me talk for a bit, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, wriggling down from my arms and running off toward the living room. I watched him go, my heart softening. If only everything in my life could be as simple as Merlin&#39;s joy over his little forts and pretend castles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back to see Benedicta watching me with a gentle smile, though her eyes seemed to hold a hint of concern. She motioned me over to the kitchen table, and we both sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta,&#34; I began, taking a steadying breath. &#34;I&#39;ve been trying to reach Luca all morning, but his phone keeps going straight to voicemail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s smile faded slightly, her brow furrowing. &#34;That&#39;s strange. He always keeps his phone on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, the worry that had been gnawing at me since breakfast resurfacing. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be so concerned, but this morning a phone was found outside Finn&#39;s gate. I have a feeling it&#39;s Luca&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a sharp breath, her expression turning serious. &#34;Luca went to see you last night, didn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, pressing my lips together, unsure of how much to reveal. &#34;Yes. I think he might have been outside, trying to reach me. But Finn&#39;s guards must have scared him off, and he must have left his phone behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s face filled with worry as she took this in. &#34;If that phone was Luca&#39;s, and it was found by Finn&#39;s people&#34; She trailed off, her fingers tracing patterns on the table as she seemed to be calculating the risks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door opened, and Luca walked in, his gaze flickering between us, clearly sensing the tension in the room. &#34;Lia,&#34; he said, his expression softening when he saw me. &#34;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta looked up, her relief clear. &#34;Luca! Lia was just telling me about the phone. Is it true? Did you leave your phone outside Finn&#39;s gate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s face tightened slightly, a flicker of frustration crossing his features. &#34;Yes,&#34; he admitted, his voice steady. &#34;I threw it. I was angry, and I wasn&#39;t exactly thinking straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, my own worry mixing with relief. &#34;But what if Finn finds it? What if he-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held up a hand, cutting me off. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I already deactivated everything on the phone remotely. All the data&#39;s wiped clean. There&#39;s nothing on there that could trace it back to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s shoulders relaxed, though she still looked troubled. &#34;Are you sure, Luca? Finn&#39;s pack has a way of digging deeper than most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded confidently. &#34;I&#39;m sure. There&#39;s nothing left for them to find. I made sure of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of relief washed over me, and I rose from my seat, crossing the room to where he stood. Without thinking, I wrapped my arms around him, feeling the familiar comfort of his presence steadying me. He returned the embrace, his arms warm and reassuring around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I murmured, my voice barely above a whisper. &#34;For always being there, even when things get complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze, his voice soft as he replied, &#34;I&#39;d do anything for you, Lia. You know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We pulled apart, but the warmth of his support lingered, giving me the strength I needed to face whatever came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ii2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Luca&#39;s reassurances about the phone, I felt a weight lift, but my mind still buzzed with the uncertainty of everything unfolding around me. As Benedicta and I stood by the front door, waiting for my cab to arrive, I could see the worry in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. &#34;Lia, are you certain you want to go back today?&#34; Her tone was soft but probing. &#34;It seems complicated there. And with Bianca stirring things up, maybe you could use a little more time away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a small smile, appreciating her concern. &#34;I know, Benedicta. But if I leave things hanging, Bianca will only get bolder. And Finn-he needs to hear the truth from me before he hears any more half-truths from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sighed, pulling me into a hug. &#34;Just be careful, all right?&#34; She stepped back, her gaze serious. &#34;I know you&#39;re strong, but that doesn&#39;t mean you need to do it all alone. Promise you&#39;ll reach out if things get too difficult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise.&#34; I gave her hand a reassuring squeeze just as the cab pulled up in front of the house. &#34;Thank you-for everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, a sad smile softening her expression as she watched me head down the driveway and into the waiting cab. As the car pulled away, I leaned back into the seat, bracing myself for what awaited me at Finn&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive back was uneventful, but as we neared the gates, a growing sense of dread stirred in me. I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that today was going to bring more challenges. And, as if on cue, the moment I stepped out of the cab and headed toward the entrance, Bianca appeared from the side path, as though she&#39;d been waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; she greeted, her voice laced with sweetness that dripped with insincerity. Her gaze swept over me, assessing, her lips curving into a smirk. &#34;You&#39;re finally back. I was beginning to think you&#39;d decided to abandon your role here altogether.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my chin, refusing to let her bait me. &#34;Nice to see you too, Bianca,&#34; I replied, keeping my tone steady. &#34;Though I&#39;d expect that by now, you&#39;d have grown used to people having other business outside these walls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes, not even trying to hide her disdain. &#34;Funny you should say that, Lia. I&#39;ve been meaning to talk to you about your extracurricular activities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched an eyebrow, feigning surprise. &#34;Oh? I wasn&#39;t aware I needed to account for every moment of my time with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;You may think you can do as you please, but let me remind you, you&#39;re marrying into a family that has standards. And disappearing without a word, leaving Finn to clean up your mess-like that little incident with your car-isn&#39;t exactly becoming of his future wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw, forcing myself to stay composed. &#34;I trust Finn knows what kind of person I am, Bianca. And he certainly doesn&#39;t need you speaking on his behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step closer, her voice lowering, as though sharing a secret. &#34;You really think he doesn&#39;t see through you? Believe me, it won&#39;t be long before he realizes that all you&#39;re doing is pretending.&#34; She leaned back, crossing her arms with a satisfied smile. &#34;After all, it&#39;s only a matter of time before you reveal your true colors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her gaze, refusing to back down. &#34;I&#39;d be careful if I were you, Bianca. You might find that the people you&#39;re so desperate to deceive are already watching you closely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smirk faltered for just an instant, but she quickly recovered, tossing her hair over her shoulder. &#34;Enjoy playing pretend while it lasts,&#34; she said, brushing past me with one last withering look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her go, a sense of calm defiance settling over me. If Bianca wanted to play this game, then I would make sure she knew exactly who she was dealing with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the morning&#39;s chaos, I was determined to put the issue of the phone behind us. The guards had reviewed the CCTV footage, meticulously scanning each frame for clues about the phone&#39;s origin, but it had turned up nothing. Whoever had left it there had been careful, or perhaps lucky, leaving us with nothing useful. All we had was a phone with no apparent links to its owner-no photos, contacts, or messages. Just a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the whole thing left me uneasy, and not just because of Bianca&#39;s constant insinuations about Lia. She had been quick to plant seeds of suspicion, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to believe them. Lia wasn&#39;t the type to keep secrets, not like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sitting in my office, the phone lying on my desk as I stared at it, lost in thought. The investigation felt like a loose thread I couldn&#39;t pull, and the more I thought about it, the more it gnawed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, and I looked up to see Alina stepping inside, her expression as smug as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still brooding over that phone, Finn?&#34; she asked, clearly enjoying my frustration. &#34;Or maybe it&#39;s Lia&#39;s latest disappearance that has you so on edge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, already weary of her meddling. &#34;Alina, I&#39;m not in the mood for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged, leaning casually against the doorway. &#34;I&#39;m just trying to help, you know. But if you&#39;re so determined to ignore every red flag, then by all means, keep going.&#34; Her gaze drifted to the phone on my desk. &#34;But don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you when things start falling apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my teeth, barely restraining my irritation. &#34;Alina, Lia has done nothing to warrant this constant suspicion. That phone could belong to anyone, and without any evidence, there&#39;s no reason to jump to conclusions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. &#34;Suit yourself, Finn. But remember, I know what I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;d hate to see you blindsided because you refused to see the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she turned and left, leaving me alone with the unsettling reminder of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>113</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The low hum of the afternoon lull drifted through the room as Jenny and I sat across from each other, an unspoken understanding thickening the air between us. The plan had taken shape in my mind, piece by piece, each detail carefully calculated. Lia had lingered in Finn&#39;s life far too long, a thorn in my side and a threat to the future I deserved. If Lia was going to stand in my way, she needed to be removed-permanently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny shifted in her seat, studying me with that sharp, almost predatory look I&#39;d come to expect from her. She wasn&#39;t the woman I used to know; there was something harder, colder in her gaze now. But then again, maybe that&#39;s why she was perfect for this plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s next?&#34; she asked, a hint of impatience in her voice. &#34;We&#39;ve gone over the details, Bianca. We&#39;ve done the groundwork. When do we actually make this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin smile crept over my lips. &#34;Soon, Jenny. Very soon. I&#39;ve already put someone on this. I&#39;m just waiting for an update.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if on cue, my phone buzzed on the table. I glanced down at the screen and felt a jolt of satisfaction. It was one of the guys I&#39;d hired to handle the mess that was Lia. Perfect timing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered, keeping my voice low. &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca, we&#39;re set. Just need final instructions and the go-ahead,&#34; the man said, his tone curt, businesslike. He&#39;d been in this line of work long enough to know when to keep his questions to a minimum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Meet me at the clearing behind the old church in an hour,&#34; I replied, my voice laced with cold efficiency. &#34;We&#39;ll finalize everything there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up, feeling the pulse of adrenaline course through me. Finally, after all the planning and all the frustration of watching Lia worm her way into Finn&#39;s life, we were on the brink of getting what we wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. &#34;Was that him? Our &#39;solution&#39; to the Lia problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I confirmed, a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of my mouth. &#34;I&#39;m meeting him soon to go over the final details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny leaned forward, a glint of excitement in her eyes. &#34;Good. Then I&#39;m coming with you. We&#39;re in this together, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I considered turning her down-this wasn&#39;t her fight, not directly, and if things went sideways, I didn&#39;t want her getting in the way. But as I met her determined gaze, I knew there was no use arguing. She was just as invested in Lia&#39;s removal as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I said with a nod. &#34;But keep it discreet. We can&#39;t afford any mistakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a wicked smile. &#34;You can count on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay stretched out on my bed, letting the quiet wash over me. The past few days had been chaotic, the pressure of the impending wedding looming larger than I&#39;d expected. Finn and I were supposed to get married in two days, yet my heart felt heavier with each passing moment. I didn&#39;t know what I was waiting for-some clarity, maybe, or a sign that this was truly what I wanted. But that certainty eluded me, leaving only a hollow ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet knock on my door startled me, and before I could respond, Finn walked in. His expression was softer than usual, a strange combination of calm and something else-something almost cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he greeted, coming to sit on the edge of the bed beside me. &#34;How are you feeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a small smile, hoping to mask the confusion still lingering in my mind. &#34;Just resting. Trying to take in everything before the big day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, his gaze thoughtful. &#34;I thought we could talk about the wedding. Make sure we&#39;re on the same page.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I replied, sitting up and giving him my full attention. There was a look in his eyes, something searching, almost as if he were trying to read the hidden thoughts behind my expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he began, his tone cautious. &#34;I want to make sure this is truly what you want. That you don&#39;t feel pressured in any way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to hold his gaze, sensing the careful probing beneath his words. &#34;I agreed to marry you, Finn,&#34; I said, my voice steady. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be here if I didn&#39;t think this was right for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded slowly, but I could see he wasn&#39;t entirely satisfied. &#34;It&#39;s just sometimes it feels like there&#39;s a part of you that&#39;s holding back. I know Bianca can be difficult, but I don&#39;t want anything clouding your feelings about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a breath, choosing my words carefully. &#34;Bianca isn&#39;t the reason for any hesitation, Finn. I I&#39;ve just had a lot on my mind. This wedding, our future-it&#39;s all happening so fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression softened, a hint of relief breaking through his initial concern. &#34;I understand. I just want to make sure that we&#39;re moving forward together, with complete trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a small nod, wishing I could give him more. &#34;I appreciate that, Finn. And I want us to have a future that&#39;s built on trust too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence settled between us, comfortable yet fraught with the weight of unspoken questions. But before either of us could say more, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He glanced at the screen, and his expression shifted, becoming more focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I have to take this,&#34; he said, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it something important?&#34; I asked, curiosity piqued by the sudden change in his demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn hesitated, glancing back at me. &#34;It&#39;s about the phone found outside the gate. They may have found a clue as to who owns it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat, though I forced myself to stay calm. &#34;Oh? I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d find much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small shrug. &#34;Neither did I. But we&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll let you know if there&#39;s anything worth mentioning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, watching him as he left the room, his figure disappearing into the hallway. The door clicked shut behind him, and I sat there, my mind spinning.</p>
