                <p>The air was thick with something ancient, something impossible. It wasn&#39;t just the ruins that had awoken it was the past itself, shaking off centuries of dust, rising to meet her call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stood motionless, every muscle in her body coiled tight as the howls carried through the night. They weren&#39;t just sounds. They were memories, warnings, and declarations of war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves behind her felt it too. Their golden eyes flickered with something close to unease, their bodies tense, their instincts screaming at them to move, run, fight.</p>

                <p>She stood at the center of it all, fire curling beneath her skin, welcoming it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran shifted beside her, his hands curled into fists, his breathing sharp and controlled, but his voice was quiet. &#34;Tell me you know what&#39;s happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t answer. Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she was listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The howls weren&#39;t wild or directionless. They were coming from somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then she felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shift in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A presence pressing against her ribs, curling through her lungs, recognizing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past knew her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, it was answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena exhaled sharply, adjusting the grip on her daggers. &#34;I hate to be the one to say it, but should we be concerned? Or, I don&#39;t know, running?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley took a slow step forward, toward the sound, toward the pull thrumming beneath her skin. &#34;No one&#39;s running.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins around them groaned, the stones shifting beneath their feet as if something beneath them was stirring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low growl rippled through the pack. Not from fear, not from hesitation from readiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if something was coming, they weren&#39;t going to wait for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would meet it head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s voice was steady but edged with warning. &#34;Riley, talk to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled, her hands curling at her sides, flames flickering at her fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were never gone,&#34; she murmured. &#34;They were waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell between them, broken only by the wind cutting through the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s heart pounded as she turned to face them all, the fire in her veins rising with something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something she hadn&#39;t just accepted something she had claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The ones who died fighting for this place.&#34; Her voice was steady, unshaken. &#34;The ones who were erased</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The earth shuddered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a quake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something breaking free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep, bone-rattling sound echoed beneath them as if the ruins themselves were exhaling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows, from the distant cliffs beyond the ruins, figures began to appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved slowly, at first. Shadows stretching, twisting in the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then they stepped into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not ghosts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not quite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massive, hulking beasts with eyes that burned like embers, fur streaked with something darker than shadow. Not alive, but not dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in-between.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something time had failed to erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack stiffened, the younger wolves shifting uneasily, but no one moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the dead had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they were staring directly at Riley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, measured breath filled her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have been afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because deep down, she knew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had come for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The largest of them stepped forward, its golden eyes flickering in the dim light, unwavering, unblinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted her chin, feeling the weight of every choice that had led her here, every battle, every betrayal, every moment she had spent clawing her way back to the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had called them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, they wanted to know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The massive wolf let out a deep, guttural sound, not a snarl, not a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, unshaken, meeting its burning gaze with one of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We finish what they started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air shifted like the very world itself had just exhaled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment the dead wolves bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of stillness spread through the pack, an unspoken energy crackling in the air like the moment before a lightning strike. No one spoke. No one breathed. The living wolves stood frozen, their golden eyes wide with disbelief, but Riley didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dead did not bow for just anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They did not acknowledge the unworthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t a submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vow renewed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A kingdom rising from the ashes of time itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire beneath her skin surged, responding to the weight of it all, to the moment itself because this was it. This was the shift, the point of no return, the thing that had been building inside her since the day she first learned she was never supposed to exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had erased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had rewritten history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had buried her name, her kingdom, and her people, thinking that would be enough to silence her forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nothing buried in the past stayed there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they would pay for what they had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The largest of the wolves lifted its head, golden eyes burning, waiting for her next move. The others remained still, their hulking bodies poised, their presence stronger than a shadow, more solid than memory. They weren&#39;t ghosts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were the warriors who had been waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For their second war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow breath curled through Riley&#39;s lips, measured and deliberate, but her pulse thundered in her ears. She felt the past pressing down on her, the weight of a thousand voices that had been stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, they had given her back their loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, locking eyes with the wolf in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her boots touched the stone before them, the ruins responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep, shuddering tremor rippled beneath her feet. Dust rained from the broken ceiling, the faint glow of the ancient carvings pulsing stronger, brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena exhaled sharply, her fingers twitching toward her daggers. &#34;So, just checking are we all seeing the same nightmare fuel, or am I the only one who needs a drink right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s voice was quiet, intense. &#34;They&#39;re real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a slow, sharp laugh. &#34;Fantastic. Ghost wolves are real. The apocalypse is officially here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley barely heard them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she knew what came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just a moment of reunion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a moment of convergence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past was not just waking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was merging with the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her people had not been erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been waiting for her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted a hand, fire curling at her fingertips, not in threat, but in command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The massive wolf held her gaze for a heartbeat longer then it bowed lower, pressing its massive head to the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And one by one, the rest of them followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The army of the forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Warriors lost to time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves who had died defending her throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran through the living pack, as if they, too, could feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a slow breath. &#34;Sweetheart, if you&#39;re not planning to say something really dramatic right now, I&#39;m going to be very disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s lips curled into a slow, fierce smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face her pack both the living and the dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They erased us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words carried through the ruins, sharp as a blade, fierce as fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They buried our names. They rewrote history to make sure we were forgotten. They thought if they erased me, they erased all of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fire burned hotter, illuminating the cracks in the stone, and making the glowing carvings shine brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled through the ruins and the echoes of her words carried into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took another step forward, her gaze sweeping over the army that had risen at her call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will come for us. They will try to silence us again. But this time&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fire flared higher, casting golden light across the wolves, across the ruins, across everything that had once been hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This time, we won&#39;t fall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep growl rumbled from the ghostly wolves, a sound so low and powerful it vibrated in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s green eyes burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We take back everything they stole. We burn down their world. And when they beg for mercy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We remind them why they should have feared us in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the dead wolves howled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just a few.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound split through the ruins, shaking the air itself, rising into the sky like a war cry that had been centuries in the making.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living wolves followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another, their voices joining the dead, merging, becoming one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world had tried to erase them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it will be remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this wasn&#39;t just the moment Riley reclaimed her throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the moment she declared war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the world would feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The echoes of their howls stretched far beyond the ruins, ripping through the night like a warning, like a promise, like the sound of something unstoppable rising from the ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere, in the distant shadows, their enemies were listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere, the ones who had erased her, the ones who had rewritten history, the ones who had tried to bury this kingdom beneath time itself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the first time in centuries</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this was not just a power shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not just a single girl reclaiming what had been stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a reckoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air itself seemed to pulse with the weight of what had been set in motion, the howls of the living and the dead entwining into something more than sound, something felt deep in the bones of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far beyond the ruins, beyond the forests and the cities built on stolen land, beyond the reach of those who had once held the strings of fate in their hands, they knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past had not died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The queen they had erased was not only alive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was bringing hell with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let the fire in her veins burn brighter, let the howls carry her name into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would not stop until everything they built was nothing but ash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until their towers crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until their lies were burned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until every name they had stolen, every truth they had buried, was dragged back into the light where it belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it now, the fear curling through the night like smoke, reaching those who had thought themselves untouchable. The ones who had controlled history, who had shaped the world to fit their will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had spent centuries erasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was coming to erase them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted her chin, her green eyes fierce and unrelenting as the fire between her fingers crackled, hungry, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once been a forgotten name, a stolen memory, a girl lost in a war she hadn&#39;t understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was at war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when she came for them when she shattered the world they had built, when she burned through their power with a vengeance written in fire and blood</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would know exactly what they had unleashed.</p>
