                <p>Sophia felt a surge of hope. This could actually work. They could save Aquaria without opening it completely to the surface world-a temporary solution that would buy them time to find a permanent one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without warning, alarms blared throughout the facility. The security monitors flickered, showing heavily armed soldiers approaching the main gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re overriding our security protocols,&#34; Victoria said, urgency in her voice. &#34;Someone gave them access codes.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;We need more time!&#34; Sophia shouted over the alarms. &#34;The connection isn&#39;t stable yet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael grabbed his trident. &#34;I&#39;ll hold them off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Sophia caught his arm. &#34;We need you here. Your connection to the barriers is vital.&#34; She turned to Victoria. &#34;Can your security team delay them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was already on her phone. &#34;They&#39;ll try, but against military forces...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another alarm sounded, this one from the equipment monitoring the Heartstone. The stone&#39;s glow had become erratic, pulsing faster and brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s wrong,&#34; Chen yelled. &#34;The energy patterns are fluctuating!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s voice echoed from her tank. &#34;The breaches in Aquaria-they&#39;re changing! Something is forcing them wider!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia rushed to the monitoring station. The holographic map showed the corruption surging through the partially stabilized breaches, as if something was deliberately counteracting their efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It knows what we&#39;re doing,&#34; Tharros said, his voice filled with dread. &#34;The corruption is fighting back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The facility shook as an explosion rocked the entrance. On the security monitors, soldiers poured through the damaged gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re out of time,&#34; Victoria said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked at the struggling connection between the Heartstone and the barriers, then at the approaching soldiers. A desperate idea formed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to channel all power to one breach instead of eight,&#34; she said quickly. &#34;Create one stable pathway rather than trying to fix everything at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which breach?&#34; Kael asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia pointed to the holographic map, to the breach nearest the palace. &#34;This one. If we can secure a stable channel between this facility and the palace, we can move everyone and everything through it before the military takes control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bridge between worlds,&#34; Tharros murmured. &#34;It could work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it,&#34; Victoria commanded, already organizing her staff for evacuation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia and Chen quickly recalibrated the equipment, redirecting all power to a single barrier fragment. Arin focused her spells, while Tharros and Kael placed their hands directly on the Heartstone, channeling their connection to Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stone&#39;s light stabilized, becoming a steady, brilliant beam that shot from the fragment toward the ceiling. The air above the platform began to shimmer and distort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s opening!&#34; someone shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shimmering air split open, revealing a swirling portal of water and light. Through it, they could see the coral palace of Aquaria, damaged but still standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Energy signature stabilizing,&#34; Chen reported, his voice filled with awe. &#34;The quantum field is harmonizing with the magical frequency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped toward the portal, hardly daring to believe they&#39;d succeeded. She reached out, her fingers passing through the boundary with nothing more than a tingle of energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s stable,&#34; she confirmed, joy spreading through her despite the chaos around them. &#34;We&#39;ve created a direct channel between worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was already organizing the evacuation. &#34;Everyone, gather essential equipment and prepare to move through! Security teams, defensive positions!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As scientists and mer-people began rushing to collect their work, Sophia turned to her three partners. In their faces, she saw the same mix of hope and determination that she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did it,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros took her hand. &#34;This is just the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another explosion shook the building, closer this time. The military was fighting its way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the portal, more Aquarians appeared, warriors summoned by Kael to help defend the bridge between worlds. They emerged from the water with weapons ready, scales gleaming under the harsh laboratory lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the first soldiers burst into the command room, Sophia stood with Tharros, Kael, and Arin in front of the portal-four rulers united in defense of both their worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Heartstone pulsed between them, its light growing stronger as their resolve hardened. The bridge was open. Now they just had to hold it long enough to save everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And somewhere, in both worlds, the corruption continued to spread, guided by the unseen hand of the Voidcallers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poison Tide</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temporary bridge between worlds had been open for five days. Five days of frantic activity as equipment, people, and knowledge flowed between the Oceanic Research Institute and the underwater palace of Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia hadn&#39;t slept more than four hours at a stretch, her body running on adrenaline and determination. Standing on the institute&#39;s roof under the early morning sun, she finally allowed herself a moment to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beautiful, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Tharros appeared beside her, his human form still showing faint scales along his neck that caught the sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The calm before the storm,&#34; Sophia replied, her eyes fixed on the horizon where military vessels patrolled just beyond the institute&#39;s property line. &#34;Victoria says they&#39;ll make another attempt to breach our security by noon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;We&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange sound drew their attention seaward-a seagull&#39;s cry that twisted halfway through into something unnatural. The bird spiraled down, hitting the water with a splash. It didn&#39;t resurface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the third one today,&#34; Sophia said, a chill running through her despite the warm sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Below them, the institute&#39;s private dock showed signs of something wrong. The usually clear water had taken on a faint purplish tinge. A small school of fish floated belly-up near the pilings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s following us,&#34; Tharros said grimly. &#34;The corruption has found our bridge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach dropped. &#34;We need to tell the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The command room buzzed with voices as Sophia and Tharros shared what they&#39;d seen. Kael slammed his fist against the table, rattling equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should have expected this,&#34; he growled. &#34;The corruption isn&#39;t mindless. It hunts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin floated in her tank, her pale fingers tracing patterns that left glowing symbols in the water. &#34;The barrier we created isn&#39;t just letting us through. It&#39;s letting the corruption out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Chen approached with a tablet, his face grim. &#34;Three researchers have reported skin rashes with unusual patterns. Two more are experiencing auditory hallucinations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long?&#34; Sophia asked, her scientist&#39;s mind already calculating possibilities and solutions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First symptoms appeared twelve hours ago,&#34; Chen replied. &#34;Progressing rapidly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria Shaw entered the room, flanked by her security team. Unlike the chaos around her, she remained perfectly composed, though Sophia noticed dark circles under her makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The military&#39;s medical team is requesting access,&#34; Victoria said. &#34;They&#39;re detecting &#39;biological anomalies&#39; in the water surrounding our facility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t let them in,&#34; Kael insisted. &#34;If they see the portal-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we don&#39;t address the corruption spreading to surface waters, we won&#39;t need to worry about the portal,&#34; Sophia interrupted. &#34;They&#39;ll have a real ecological disaster to investigate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s voice echoed from her tank, haunting and musical. &#34;The corruption feeds on fear. The more they panic, the faster it will spread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden commotion at the side entrance drew everyone&#39;s attention. Two security guards helped a third who stumbled between them, his eyes unfocused, skin gleaming with sweat. Purple veins stood out against his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus collapsed during his patrol of the eastern perimeter,&#34; one guard explained. &#34;He was checking reports of dead fish washing up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus looked up, his eyes suddenly focusing on Sophia with unnatural sharpness. &#34;I can hear them,&#34; he whispered. &#34;Voices in the deep, calling, calling...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security guard convulsed, his back arching. When his eyes opened again, the pupils had changed-vertical slits, like a reptile&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Voidcallers send their regards,&#34; he hissed in a voice not his own. Then he collapsed, unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt cold fear grip her heart as medical staff rushed to help. This was worse than she&#39;d imagined. The corruption wasn&#39;t just affecting the water-it was spreading to people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to contain this,&#34; she said, turning to her three partners. &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, his human disguise slipping further as anger rippled through him. Scales spread across his cheeks, his eyes turning to molten gold. &#34;I can purify small areas with dragon fire. It&#39;s temporary, but it might slow the spread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll help coordinate from Aquaria,&#34; Kael said, gripping his trident. &#34;Our warriors can patrol the underwater boundaries of the institute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;ll adapt my barrier spells,&#34; Arin added, her hands still moving in complex patterns. &#34;If we can&#39;t close the bridge yet, we can at least try to filter what passes through it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia watched Marcus being carried away, his body still twitching. Science and magic, surface and sea-they&#39;d succeeded in building a bridge, but at what cost?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The institute&#39;s beachfront had been evacuated, yellow caution tape fluttering in the breeze. Dead fish littered the sand, their scales showing the same purple tinge Sophia had noticed earlier. The stench was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood at a safe distance with Dr. Chen and a small team equipped with specialized sensors. All wore protective gear-not that it would matter if the corruption truly decided to take them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready?&#34; Sophia asked through her mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chen nodded, adjusting his monitoring equipment. &#34;Recording all wavelengths. If there&#39;s energy involved, we&#39;ll detect it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Further down the beach, Victoria Shaw kept military observers at bay with a barrage of legal documents and carefully crafted excuses. The standoff wouldn&#39;t last much longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros walked alone to the water&#39;s edge, barefoot and shirtless despite the cool breeze. Even in human form, his presence commanded attention, an ancient power barely contained by fragile flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s magnificent,&#34; Chen murmured beside her, then looked embarrassed. &#34;Scientifically speaking, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia smiled despite their dire circumstances. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros reached the waterline and paused, his toes touching the contaminated surf. He closed his eyes, his chest expanding as he drew in a deep breath. Then another. And another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air around him began to shimmer with heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Energy readings spiking,&#34; Chen reported, his voice tight with excitement. &#34;Temperature increasing exponentially.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros opened his eyes, now blazing with inner fire. When he spoke, his voice carried across the beach despite the crashing waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Tharros, Dragon King of Aquaria, Master of the Deep Currents, Keeper of Ancient Flame.&#34; Each title seemed to make him stand taller, his human form stretching, changing. &#34;By my right as ruler, I command this corruption to cease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scales erupted across his skin, no longer just hints but a full transformation. His spine elongated, shoulders broadening impossibly. What stood at the water&#39;s edge was no longer human-shaped but a magnificent hybrid-part man, part dragon, fully terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Sophia heard gasps and curses from the research team. Someone dropped a tablet with a clatter. But she couldn&#39;t look away from Tharros.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his arms, now ending in clawed hands, toward the sky. His chest glowed orange from within, like a forge heating up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fire cleanses,&#34; he roared. &#34;Fire purifies!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought his hands down toward the water, and from his mouth erupted a stream of blue-white flame so intense Sophia had to shield her eyes. The fire didn&#39;t behave like normal flame-it flowed like liquid, spreading across the water&#39;s surface in expanding rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where the dragon-fire touched, the purple tinge in the water hissed and steamed away. Dead fish turned to ash. The very air seemed to clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s working,&#34; Chen whispered in awe. &#34;The contamination levels are dropping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sophia saw the strain on Tharros&#39;s face, the way his transformed body trembled with effort. This power came at a cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the last of the flame dissipated, Tharros fell to his knees in the surf. The transformation reversed itself, scales receding, body returning to human proportions. By the time Sophia reached him, he looked human again, though utterly exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t tell me it would drain you like this,&#34; she said, helping him to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a weak smile. &#34;Would it have mattered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she admitted. &#34;But I would have prepared better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, the research team stood frozen, instruments forgotten as they stared at what they&#39;d just witnessed. Science and myth had collided before their eyes, leaving their worldview in shambles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And beyond them, at the perimeter, military personnel had stopped listening to Victoria&#39;s legal arguments. Their attention was fixed on the beach where a man had just transformed and breathed fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem,&#34; Victoria said, approaching rapidly. &#34;They saw everything. They&#39;re calling for backup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked at Tharros, then at the now-clean water, already showing faint purple tendrils returning at its edges. His cleansing was temporary. The corruption couldn&#39;t be burned away so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get everyone back to the portal,&#34; she told Victoria. &#34;We need to accelerate the evacuation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the military?&#34; Victoria asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked at the soldiers who were now advancing, weapons drawn. &#34;They&#39;re the least of our worries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if in answer, a tremor shook the ground beneath their feet. Out in the bay, the water began to churn, a massive whirlpool forming where no current should exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From its center rose something vast and dark, purple corruption dripping from scaled tentacles that reached toward the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Voidcallers,&#34; Tharros whispered, his exhausted body tensing once more. &#34;They&#39;ve found us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exposed Secrets</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The massive tentacled creature rising from the bay froze everyone in place-soldiers, scientists, and mer-people alike. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it sank back beneath the waves, leaving only churning purple water as evidence it had ever existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you waiting for?&#34; Sophia shouted, breaking the spell. &#34;Everyone back to the portal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The research team scrambled into action, but it was too late for secrecy. Military personnel were already radioing their command, their voices carrying across the suddenly quiet beach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...unknown creature, at least fifty feet tall...&#34; &#34;...civilian transformed into some kind of reptilian hybrid...&#34; &#34;...requesting immediate backup and containment protocols...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria snatched Sophia&#39;s arm as they hurried toward the institute. &#34;Someone&#39;s livestreaming.&#34; She pointed to a small fishing boat just offshore, a civilian with a phone held high above his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach dropped. &#34;How much did he capture?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything,&#34; Victoria replied grimly. &#34;Tharros, the creature, all of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the institute&#39;s main building, chaos reigned. Scientists rushed to pack equipment while security teams barricaded entrances. Kael and a group of mer-warriors emerged from the portal, weapons ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The corruption is attacking the palace&#39;s eastern wing,&#34; Kael reported, water still streaming from his armor. &#34;We&#39;ve evacuated the children and elders to the deep caverns, but our defenses are failing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Chen rushed toward them, his tablet displaying multiple news feeds. &#34;It&#39;s already online,&#34; he said breathlessly. &#34;The footage. It&#39;s everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia watched in horror as shaky video played across the screen. There was Tharros, transforming into his dragon form, breathing blue fire across the water. Then the massive tentacled thing rising from the bay. The clip ended with military personnel drawing weapons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seventeen million views in six minutes,&#34; Chen said. &#34;Every major news outlet is picking it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the wail of sirens grew closer. Helicopter rotors thundered overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to move everything through the portal now,&#34; Kael insisted. &#34;Seal it behind us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And abandon the surface to the corruption?&#34; Sophia asked. &#34;It won&#39;t stay contained. You saw how quickly it spread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros, still weak from his cleansing effort, leaned against a table. &#34;The Voidcallers want this,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;Fear between our worlds feeds their power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive explosion rocked the building as the military breached the outer perimeter. Glass shattered. Warning lights flashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have fifteen minutes before they reach the command center,&#34; Victoria said, checking security feeds. &#34;Maybe less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chen cleared his throat. &#34;There&#39;s another way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t hide anymore,&#34; he said, gesturing to the news feeds where &#34;MONSTERS REAL!&#34; headlines screamed across the screen. &#34;But we can control the narrative.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you suggesting?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A controlled disclosure,&#34; Chen replied. &#34;We give them a version of the truth they can handle. One that doesn&#39;t cause mass panic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want us to lie?&#34; Kael scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want us to survive,&#34; Chen shot back with unexpected force. &#34;All of us-surface and sea. If humans believe you&#39;re all monsters, they&#39;ll try to destroy you. If the corruption spreads unchecked, it will destroy everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another explosion, closer this time. The lights flickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly did you have in mind?&#34; Victoria asked, her business mind already calculating possibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chen pointed to Sophia. &#34;People trust scientists. She explains that we&#39;ve discovered an ancient underwater civilization that&#39;s been living peacefully alongside humanity for centuries. We frame the corruption as an environmental threat affecting both worlds. We ask for cooperation, not conflict.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It could work,&#34; Arin said, surprising everyone. She had emerged from her water tank and stood dripping on the floor. &#34;Humans fear what they don&#39;t understand. Give them understanding, and fear becomes curiosity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked at each of her partners&#39; faces. &#34;We&#39;d need to simplify a lot. Leave out the magical aspects-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And my true nature,&#34; Tharros added, a muscle twitching in his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now,&#34; Sophia agreed. &#34;We present you as ambassadors from an advanced underwater civilization. We focus on the corruption as the common enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria was already on her phone. &#34;I can set up a live broadcast. All major networks. Ten minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The military won&#39;t just stand down,&#34; Kael warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will if their superiors order it,&#34; Victoria replied. &#34;I still have friends in high places. I&#39;ll buy us time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt the weight of worlds settling on her shoulders. &#34;This changes everything. There&#39;s no going back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There never was,&#34; Tharros said gently. &#34;Not since the moment you pulled me from the deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another explosion, and the institute&#39;s power grid failed. Emergency lights bathed everyone in eerie red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nine minutes,&#34; Victoria said, tapping furiously on her phone. &#34;The broadcast studio on level two still has generator power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia took a deep breath. &#34;Chen, help me script this. Victoria, make your calls. Tharros, Kael, Arin-choose what parts of your world you&#39;re willing to reveal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As everyone rushed to their tasks, Sophia caught Tharros watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having second thoughts?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A million of them,&#34; she admitted. &#34;But we&#39;re out of options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eight minutes later, Sophia stood in the small broadcast studio, makeup hastily applied to hide her exhaustion. Behind her, a blue screen would be replaced with carefully selected footage of Aquaria-the beautiful parts, nothing to inspire fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria gave her a thumbs up from behind the camera. &#34;You&#39;re live in thirty seconds. Every major network and streaming platform worldwide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia smoothed her lab coat, her fingers trembling. Through the studio&#39;s window, she could see military personnel being held back by Victoria&#39;s security team. How long that standoff would last, she couldn&#39;t guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Chen handed her a tablet with their hastily prepared script. &#34;Remember, keep it simple. Focus on cooperation. Position yourself as the bridge between worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros approached, now fully human in appearance again. He took her free hand. &#34;You can do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I make it worse?&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t,&#34; he said with absolute certainty. &#34;This is why the Heartstone chose you. Not just for Aquaria, but for this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and Arin joined them, standing just out of camera range. Despite their differences, all three of her partners looked at her with the same expression-trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia set down the tablet. She wouldn&#39;t need the script. She knew what needed to be said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three. Two. One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The red light on the camera blinked on.</p>
