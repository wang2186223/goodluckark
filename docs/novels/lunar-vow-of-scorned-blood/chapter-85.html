                <p>&#34;BEGIN!&#34; Dale shouted, and my opponent didn&#39;t waste any time and rushed forward. He kicked me in the side which made me lost my balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not so tough aren&#39;t we?&#34; He uttered while smirking. I didn&#39;t say anything and returned his kick.</p>

                <p>All I did was blocked him, he wasn&#39;t thinking anymore right now and just want to completely knocked me down. But before he could even do that he was tired enough that I don&#39;t need to block his attacks. I was able to see his everymore and even predict them. And with a one swift blow I punch his stomach, making him puke blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should give up now, or else you will die.&#34; I whispered to his ear. And to my surprised he was still able to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled to myself, their skills right now is really something that I couldn&#39;t look down at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were just starting.&#34; He mumbled, wiping the blood on his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continue to fight and at the 2nd round I was able to completely made him surrender. The crowd became silent after our fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good work.&#34; Dale patted my shoulders after the fight. I didn&#39;t say anything and went out of the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got out Sarah is waiting for me and she was with Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was fast.&#34; He mumbled, but I ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just shut up Alec? Can&#39;t you see that you are disturbing us?&#34; Sarah said, while rolling her eyes. Alec just laughed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that I just want to congratulate him for winning his first game.&#34; He said, then look at me with a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, I will be looking forward on our fight.&#34; He mumbled, I didn&#39;t say anything and Sarah push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Geez! Just get out! Can&#39;t you see he wasn&#39;t interested.&#34; Alec then put his hand on the air like he was surrendering and then started walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec was called after an hour, he will be fighting against Dale&#39;s son Dexter. Dexter was a few years older than me. He was around the age of Zion&#39;s brother. And Dale was the one who trained them before they went to the South to complete their training there. Dexter was also one of the head guards of the border. And I could say his skills is something that you couldn&#39;t ignore. He was a pretty descent fighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alec was also someone that you wouldn&#39;t remember, as I watch him fight with Dexter, he was completely overpowering him. And he was aiming for all the weak spot of Dexter. He even broke his arm, making it hard for Dexter to block his attacks. And it didn&#39;t take that long to know who the winner is. Dexter got out of the arena completely bleeding while Alec wasn&#39;t even that beaten up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could he do that?&#34; Sarah whispered to herself as she watch Alec with a surprised look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? You know his skills. How could you be surprised after seeinh him fight now?&#34; She shakes her head unknowingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know Alec, and yes, he was a good fight but not like that. He wasn&#39;t that good before.&#34; She mumbled, I didn&#39;t say anything and just look at his direction. He was staring at me with a smug look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dale entered the Arena looking uncomfortable, of course that was expected after seeing what happened to his son. But he completely swallowed it away as he announced Alec as the winner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was loud when he went out of the Arena. Then he went straight towards Hunter, he then said something to him before Hunter smiled widely. How did they know each other? I don&#39;t remember seeing Hunter around Alec before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Dale announce the next participants. My mind drifted away to how was Hunter and Alec familiar with each other? I haven&#39;t seen Hunter since I was a kid. But looking at them right now, they look like they have known each other for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne?&#34; I look at Sarah who was staring at me. And now that I notice everyone is looking at my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They called you, it was your turn.&#34; She whispered, Dale stared at me like he was asking if I was okay. I nodded my head and then went back to the Arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t recognize my opponent, but right now I don&#39;t wanna waste my time fighting. So I did what I could to finish it fast. And I could say my opponent was pretty fast, unlike the first one who had a bulkier build this one was around my size, and he was fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dodge my first attack, trying to jump behind me but I caught his leg and swing him to the floor. Before he could even recover I pinned him and knocked him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My next fight was quite hard than the first two fight. Because I would start facing the winners of the first round. I even caught a bruise in my left side of my face because of my third opponent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night went fast, Alec remained to continue torturing his opponent. No one even want to fight against him as I seat next to the other participants. This time he finished all his opponent by killing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can hear the cheer of the crowd as well as their cries. I stayed quiet, not wanting to waste my energy. And when my name was called again. I finished it as quickly as I could. My opponent ended up giving up and I let him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even heard Alec said that I was boring but I choose to ignore him. I would very much like it better if he would just shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number of participants soon decrease making it into the last 8, then pairing us up into two, who will fight each other until the final two was the only remaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec easily won over his opponent. The next round and my name was called, I then did what I can to finish it quickly but this time my opponent was using a weapon. I didn&#39;t notice it at first but when he openly aim for my right leg. I almost end up falling on the floor. The knife he used looks exactly the same like what Renz used to attack me during the training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely Dale caught the sight of the weapon and disqualified my opponent. But just like what I expected, the wounds in my feet is not healing properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Dale ask, seeing how my right leg is bleeding heavily. I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? Can you still fight?&#34; Again I nodded my head. He looks hesitant at first but then nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go get your position back.&#34; He whispered then went back to the Arena to announce the next pair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that we wouldn&#39;t hold it against you if you couldn&#39;t fight anymore.&#34; Alec uttered, he looks like he was already going to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now that I notice, my opponent was actually one of his team mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You planned this all along don&#39;t you.&#34; I utteredz staring at him right in the eyes. He just laughed at me nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not, why would I tell him to injured you if I know I could finish you off myself.&#34; I just stared at him and smile which made him surprised at my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I would still beat you up even if I couldn&#39;t used my right leg.&#34; I mumbled then left him. I even heard him curse before I left him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah run towards me and check my wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you could still fight? Dwayne baby, your wound is not healing properly and by the looks of it. It has wolfsbane.&#34; She started covering my wounds. The doctor did also checked it and advice me to not fight anymore because I did lost too much blood already. But I ignored him and told him to just do whatever he can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wound was not that deep, but because he used a silver knife with a wolfsbane, my healing ability is not responsing quite well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should rest for a while. You will be fighting the next round.&#34; Sarah said, then she help me to get back to the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch the fight ended, now there are only 4 remaining participant, Dale announce all our names. Alec, Kyler, Ace and me. I would be fighting against Kyler while Alec will be against Ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first one who will fight is Alec and Ace. I sat there and watch their fight unfold. Alec did have a hard time attacking Ace, because of his fast reflexes but when Alec caught him, Ace wasn&#39;t able to get out of his grip anymore. Alec started throwing punches at him, not even caring about his words. He keep doing that until Ace was unable to move anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That man is crazy.&#34; I heard Kyler said behind me. I didn&#39;t even know who he was talking with but the looks of it his words are directed to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m lucky that I was pair up with you. I know I wouldn&#39;t stand against you after witnessing all your fight. But I want to at least try and see how my Alpha defend his Title.&#34; He said, I smiled at his words then shake his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh are you two forming a bond knowing that you will both end up losing?&#34; Alec uttered, we didn&#39;t even notice him getting close. He was wiping his hands which is covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be so sure about that.&#34; Kyler uttered, making him received a glare at Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you I will just shut up because you are just nothing but a piece of bug to me.&#34; Alec bark, I pulled Tyler away and told him to focus on our fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Dale called for our names. Tyler and I entered the arena together. We both then bowed to each other as respect before we started fighting. And I could say that Kyler can be an omega with his skills. I was even having a hard time blocking him. He was trying to keep up with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are quite good.&#34; I uttered between our fight. He keep attacking and all I did was dodge them before I saw an opening and caught his arms the twisting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could day that to yourself.&#34; He answered back. Then he tried to used his elbow to hit my face but I was abled to respond fatser and pinned him on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think this is my chance to give up. I GIVE UP!&#34; To my surprise he didn&#39;t fight that much. I let him go and help him stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t used all your strength.&#34; I mumbled, he the shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe it or not I was trying to keep up with you but after seeing it myself. Your reflexes and hit was something that could end up killing me if you aren&#39;t controling yourself. And between us you are the one who is not using all his strength.&#34; I was stunned that he was able to notice that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything after that and he just pat my shoulders before he walks out of the arena. Dale the went inside and stand next to me. Announcing my name as the winner. The crowd was completely quiet unlike before but I couldn&#39;t care less anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Dale ask me again if I still want to continue. I then stared down at my leg and it was bleeding again. The wound probably reopened after my fight with Kyler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then nodded my head and went outside to get some bandage to tie my leg again. Kyler then throw me a bandage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider this my thanks for beating that bastard up.&#34; He uttered then lefr without waiting for my reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dale then called me and Alec.</p>
