                <p>When the gentle morning light crept into my room, I rubbed my face before slowly opening my eyes. Then for about a few minutes, I didn&#39;t blink with my sight focused on the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lying still for a while, I threw the blanket off me and sat up in bed. Then I gently rested my feet onto the cold floor, got up, and walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I got undressed, I stepped into the shower, turned it on, and leaned my head against the glass, allowing the flow of warm water to beat on my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days now, Blake has been keeping her distance. Today was the day of the full moon, and thankfully it&#39;s Sunday so I don&#39;t have to go on campus since during the full moon is when I find it the hardest to keep my wolf cage and stay in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting done with my shower and wearing something comfortable, I came downstairs for breakfast and met Blake seated at the table about to eat her plate of spaghetti she made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she lifted her head and met my gaze, she shot me a look of raw resentment, picked up her fork, and stabbed it into her spaghetti.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This has been our everyday life since we had sex, and I don&#39;t know why, but it bothered me a bit to get ignored by her, especially since it was repetitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I not get a plate?&#34; I teased, walking over to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are your two hands for, or have you forgotten to use them?&#34; Blake mumbled beneath her breath, not even raising her head to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was. The relentless rude comeback and attitudes, she keeps giving me, made my blood boil with rage and me tense with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without replying to her, I walked out of the dining room and went into the kitchen, toasted a few slices of bread, fixed myself a cup of coffee before heading back into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I sat down at the table, Blake rudely tossed her fork on the plate and said, &#34;I lost my appetite!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck is going on with you!?&#34; I lashed out, feeling pissed now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not saying a word, Blake picked up the plate of half-full spaghetti and left her seat. But as she was about to walk past me, I stood up and grabbed her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it. You are mad about me not claiming you. But you don&#39;t have to be a bitch about it!&#34; I lashed out, giving in to my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The touch of disappointment on her face deepened into a frown. Then she gave a long stare and said, &#34;You honestly think this about you not claiming me! I don&#39;t give a damn anymore if you don&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, then what&#39;s with the attitude?!&#34; I asked, studying her eyes as they darted left and right as though she was striving not to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is me taking the hint, Nero, and backing off! Detaching myself from you before I get too attached and get my heart shattered.&#34; Blake said, pulling her hand a bit. &#34;Can you let go of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I loosened my grip on Blake&#39;s arm, looked away from her, and mumbled, &#34;I get that. But can you tone down the aggression a bit? It&#39;s not fun getting insults thrown at my face every now and then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s not fun either to know that you are parading around with my sister after having sex with me.&#34; Blake blurted out, her eyes flickered with defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, a reason behind days of unnecessary arguments like this one. And now that I had the rational idea of what all her outburst was about, I still don&#39;t know how to handle this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you saw the photos,&#34; I mumbled, staring away from the rage in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna get!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else do you need to hear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about giving me some damn explanation on what&#39;s your deal with my sister?! Are you two together or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell between us as Blake coldly stared at me and since I didn&#39;t know what to say to her, I kept gazing at the wild, dangerous glitter in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are freaking unbelievable!&#34; Blake finally said. &#34;I can&#39;t wait for tonight to be over so I can get the hell out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that my next words were going to create another argument, I drew a breath and said, &#34;You can&#39;t leave this house, not when I&#39;m still your alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have never met an indecisive person like you! You want to own me, but not fully claim me! Is this some kind of sick game to you? Messing with my emotions!&#34; Blake said, staring at me stonily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like that. Even though you can conceal your scent, you bear my smell after I marked you, and I don&#39;t want others to find out that mistakenly. So until the twenty-nine day can be over...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does everything you say have to be so fucking hurtful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you keep misunderstanding me. Those words weren&#39;t meant to hurt you.&#34; I said in a calmer tone, watching her eyes widen and rim with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it did. Congratulations! I finally get the message! I&#39;m going to stay here. Happy?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try to bandage the wound you cut open. You are just going to infect it even more!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I stood still, not knowing how to react as I stared at the tears trailing down Blake&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my hands squeezed into fists, and I walked out of the dining hall, heading upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got into my room, I slammed the door shut and shouted out, &#34;Fuck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not what I signed up for when I decided to leave my pack and come here. It wasn&#39;t a part of the plan to get entangled with my very emotional enemy&#39;s daughter and lose my focus. Now I have no solid idea on how to handle this situation I have gotten intertwined in with Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking away from the door, I headed to my bed and dropped flat on the mattress. Then the silence in my room faded as I listened to her cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only I had not done what I did in the past and said those words, will I still care about Blake? But that question remains a dilemma to me that I can not seem to decide on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lying in my room for quite a while, my phone buzzed, and I gazed at the screen to see Jason&#39;s name flashing on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After answering his call, I heard him say, &#34;How&#39;s Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;End the call if she is what you call to ask me about!&#34; I said in annoyance  &#34;Also, what&#39;s up with your caring attitude towards her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were the one who told me that she&#39;s not her father and I shouldn&#39;t hate her. Plus, we are going to have a full moon today. The first shift can make a wolf have a bad temper and raging hormone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I felt pissed out at myself because I forgot what it felt like to go through your first shift. Even though Blake was angry at me, the effect of the changes happening in her body was boosting that rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Jason&#39;s voice rang in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I mumbled. &#34;Are you sure that you don&#39;t want to be with us at the villa when the full moon hits?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An Alpha, an Beta, and whatever Blake is, huddled in on place is a recipe for disaster. Blake is a handful. Handle her, and I will take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, see you tomorrow then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call with Jason, I realized that I have been laying in my room for the longest because the time was now twelve on the dot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitant, I tossed my phone on my bed and headed out of my room. When I finally reached Blake&#39;s bedroom, the door was locked, and I could hear the sound of soft cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, are you okay?&#34; I called, resting his palms against the wooden door frame as I listened. &#34;Can you open the door Please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for a brief while, the door opened, and my gaze landed on Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of us stared at each other for a while in silence, then I stroked my jaw and mumbled, &#34;Is everything alright? Do you need anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay. Isn&#39;t it normal to be in pain during your first transformation?&#34; Blake said with wet eyes. &#34;Painful, but natural. Nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you handle it? I can get some pills or something to help with the pain.&#34; I softly said with my eyes fixed on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling her brows together in a frown, Blake pushed her hair back and asked, &#34;Are you going to do that for me or yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touching the base of my neck, I tried not to get annoyed, struggling to understand her, and asked, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know To stop me from whining in your ears.&#34; Blake mumbled, her eyes flicked to me and away again. &#34; I know you are annoyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what, it&#39;s fine. Forget about it. I don&#39;t need some stupid pill. I&#39;ll be fine after the full moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frown, Blake tried to shut the door, but I blocked it with my foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you leave? I&#39;m not in the mood to argue!&#34; Blake harshly said, turning away for me and walking back into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aggression in her tone, the anger glowing in her eyes, the continued switch between moods, all of those left me with no doubt that her wolf was fully going to wake today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My biggest concern now is what&#39;s going to happen when it&#39;s unleashed, and Blake has no control over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, it can take a couple of weeks or until six months before anyone can control their wolf and calm it down. But what arises when there&#39;s no time frame for someone who&#39;s detached from their wolf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Transformation, and what she is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pale crescent half-moon shone like a bright bulb in the sky, and the cloud looked peaceful while I gazed at the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the noises of nature echoed into the room, Blake was deep in sleep. Then a sudden movement on the bed caused my attention to sway toward her, and she slowly raised her eyelashes before shutting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since it was her first transformation, it was quite slow, and Blake was subjected to three hours of intense pain, and I got worried and gave her some pills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking it, she fell asleep and has been sleeping for close to two hours now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that the full moon was up, and she could go through her transformation any time, I have been sitting here, waiting for the moment to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Blake abruptly moaned as she shifted her head left, then right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I tried to ignore it, I couldn&#39;t because her cry was becoming more of a growl. So I approached the bed, tapped her on the arm, and mumbled, &#34;Blake, wake up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly her eyelids raised, and I could see that her eyes were now red like dark blood, and I felt paralyzed, staring into them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero,&#34; Blake whispered with confusion in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her face, I watched her eyes glow with a glimpse of discomfort clouded in them. Then she reached for her blouse and took it off, tossing it on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I asked, staring as she pulled down her shorts and removed her legs from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It feels uncomfortable,&#34; Blake mumbled, the glow in her eyes becoming more intense. &#34;My body feels weird and ticklish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind went blank for a moment when I noticed the white thin hair covering her skin. Freaking unbelievable! Her wolf was actually really to show itself after nineteen years of being hidden away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Argh!&#34; A loud, robust cry rushed from her lips as Blake grabbed the sheet, yanking them tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was happening, and Blake looked in so much pain as she continued staring at my face with moist eyes and tear-stained cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the sheet upward as her fists tightened on it, Blake&#39;s chest raised aggressively, and although I was expecting a cry, she groaned fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard a shredding noise, and when I gazed at the sheet, I saw her nails growing, ripping into the cloth as she pulled harder on the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I took a step back without taking my eyes off her, realizing the change in the force from the energy she was releasing. It was nothing like I have felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Blake&#39;s normal human hands had got maimed and her skin peels away, I watched them get repaired with the large, hairy, clawed hands, and saliva-like substance oozed out along with blood from her snapping joints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her roar got louder with raw pain in every cry she made, and I stopped four feet away from her as I gazed at her entire body molding itself into its new werewolf shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of Blake&#39;s bones snapping sent chills down my spine, and I watched the gruesome transformation of her skin shredding in some places and stretching in others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my gaze swayed towards her ears, stretching up out of the side of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The transformation process was near its completion, and I could see her wolf, even though Blake was still there. It was like finally understanding when she said, &#34;To be honest, it&#39;s like it has a psyche of its own and does whatever it wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was simply amazing as I watched Blake&#39;s face pushed forward and split away as a snout forms, her jaw dislodged to make room for a massive maw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a howl escaped from her throat as fangs fit for a flesh-tearing spurt through her gums.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless, that&#39;s how I felt as I gazed at a giant white wolf with bloodthirsty red eyes on the bed, looking directly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake?&#34; I mumbled, realizing exactly what kind of wolf she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultima! That&#39;s exactly what she was. That&#39;s why her scent was so confusing from the very beginning because she was neither alpha nor omega.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ultima,&#34; are wolves that are higher than us, Alpha and Luna. They are the strongest in the pack and are very dangerous. When angered, their eyes turn red, and they can sometimes go insane with rage, or even can kill instantly if they wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Provoking me into harboring an unstable Ultima in my home, and even making it imprinted on me! What the fuck was the moon goddess thinking when my destiny was getting written.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her eyes on mine, she howled with the force of a thousand thunder. Finally, I stopped suppressing my wolf and allow it to wake, not knowing what Blake was going to do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she took a step towards me, I remained still, keeping alert, and ready to strike. Even though these breeds of werewolves are extremely powerful, Blake was still weak, and she couldn&#39;t take me on even if she tried. But I didn&#39;t plan on letting my guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Blake got out of bed. Then she moved gently to me, and when there was barely any space between us, she met my eyes and suddenly wagged her tail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she leaned towards my cheek and licked it, almost as though she was showing a sign of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this it? Was I truly bonded with an Ultima? After years of thinking that finding my mate wasn&#39;t possible, this happens. But why can&#39;t I feel it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did Luna explain the connection of the bond again? Right! A strong electricity, drawing us towards each other. That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to feel like. But I felt nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Blake nudged my shoulder with her head, and I couldn&#39;t help but smile. She was a cute wolf, despite her huge size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; I mumbled, stroking her smooth fur. &#34;You can&#39;t leave the villa. So you have to be good tonight and not cause problems for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems like she understood me because, after my remark, she let out a slow growl and gently licked my face again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, girl,&#34; I mumbled, smiling a bit widened this time as I scratched her fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in a million years would I have guessed this was where I was going to be, presently. But here I am with an unstable, powerful wolf that claimed me as her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s going to happen when she finds out what I cost her, and that I&#39;m not her mate but the enemy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Will these same jaws that puffed air in excitement want to snap my neck? Even if that&#39;s the case, revenge is greater than sentiments, and I must have mine, even if that means I get dragged to hell with all of my foes.</p>
