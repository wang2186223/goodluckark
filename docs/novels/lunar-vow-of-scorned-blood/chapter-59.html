                <p>What Sarah said is true, the celebration just started. When we came back the crowd is all cheering. I clenched my fist when I saw what they are cheering about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are like 10 Rogues inside a large cage. I didn&#39;t even notice that they prepared this thing. The rogues are fighting each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now who wants to join them?&#34; Hunter&#39;s voice came from the speakers. He was standing at the stage with the other Elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know this rogues are captured by us. They continue to roam around with a pack which resulted for them to lose their minds.&#34; He added, the crowd was cheering and shouting &#34;Kill them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet, we didn&#39;t brought them here just to kill them instantly right?&#34; Hunter smiled wickedly. And when our eyes meet his smiles widens. Like he was telling me this is how you will get your pack to your side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now why don&#39;t we choose someone from the pack to fight and kill them?&#34; He suggested, and the crowd started volunteering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his eyes is fixated on me. And I know what he was planning when he grab the mic again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we let an Alpha to do the honor of showing us the right way of killing our enemies?&#34; They all became silent and followed the direction where he was staring at and that was no other than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like the Alpha of the Crescent Moon Pack? My own great-great grandson Dwayne!&#34; They all remain silent. I can feel the hesitation in my packs eyes. And their minds even without linking on them I already knew what they are thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh common Dwayne you don&#39;t want you embarrassed your great-great-grandfather don&#39;t you?&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything. Sarah was just staring at me nervously, waiting for my response like the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step forward keeping my eyes on him. His smiles widens with satisfaction as he watch me do what he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I climbed to the huge cage. The rogues snarling as I came closer. They look like they wanted to kill me. The crowd started cheering on me most of them are from my pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now everyone let us watch the Alpha, you all will be the judge if he was still capable to be your Alpha.&#34; He uttered giving me a knowing look. I ignored his words. I&#39;m already aware that my pack wanted to challenge me for the title. And right now he was helping me to somehow gain my authority by showing them how strong and powerful am I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them all go.&#34; He mumbled, I even heard someone repeat it to confirm it to him and he nodded his head. Knowing that I know this rogues aren&#39;t the normal level one. They all had the same qualities like before but the way their eyes glows from rage was telling me that they are no longer humane, making them stronger and ruthless. A normal werewolf can only handle 1 or 2 of this type of rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they all got released. All of them went straight to me. They didn&#39;t waste any time and started attacking me. My wolf wanted to crawl out of my skin and tear them apart but I didn&#39;t let him. If I want to gain their trust back I need to show them that I was capable even without my wolf&#39;s help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them tried to aim for my abdomen, which barely scratch my shirt. The crowd gasp, I felt the other one presence above me and the sharpe intake of his breath is telling me that he will attack from my behind. I quickly bend my body avoiding his attack. He was cut off by his own grunt when I threw my punch and elbowed the other one. They both lost their balance. I looked straight up at the remaining rogues who still can stand and gave them a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This they all attacked me again one of them successfully hit me making me strangle for a bit, then the other one jump to my back. Aiming for me neck. I stop his head right in time. Throwing another punch, a solid right hook. When his weight was lifted off of me I jumped to my feet without a spare moment crouching low. He whines at my attacks. Then I focus on the other one near me. Noticing his outline is showing tightly while I was pushed back several feet. I heard the snap of his canines as he tried to bite my face as he trembled violently with his growls. Both of my hands are occupied and I still have to think of ways to stop the other rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a sigh, then snap his head with my bare hands. I couldn&#39;t think of another way to do it fast. The crowd was silent the whole time. All eyes are watching me. I can feel his gaze from the back of my head. I know he was enjoying himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved to the other remaining rogues, I did it as quick as possible. Aiming for their heads I snap it one by one until I was left with only one rogue. This wolf is smaller than the other ones, she was a female I&#39;m sure of it. As I slowly made my way towards her, I can smell her fear. Her eyes stared at me with fear and hesitation. And with that she shifted back to her human form. I was more surprised to see her having a normal behavior like a normal werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t kill me! I wouldn&#39;t come back here please! I only want a pack to belong to. I didn&#39;t know I&#39;m sorry!&#34; She continue mumbling while weeping. She look like she was a few years younger than me. Strawberry blond hair her eyes were blue. Her skinny body trembled in fear as I stood a few feet away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please I wouldn&#39;t dare to fight you if they didn&#39;t promise to spare my life if I didn&#39;t do what they told me to do.&#34; The crowd started shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was lying! She was a rogue!&#34; Some said from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh common kill her!&#34; Someone shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at his direction, he was waiting for my response. Is this even necessary? She was still young. I look at the crowd most of the one shouting was from the families who died in the Island. They probably believe that it was the rogues doing and Klaire was one of them. I don&#39;t know who started spreading rumors about this. This also leads for them to lose their faith from the Royalties because Klaire was one of them. They believe that the previous attack were all part of their plans and seeing Klaire didn&#39;t come back with us only added to their speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I whispered, then grab her neck. &#34;I will make it quick.&#34; With that I heard her bones crack as I snap his neck. Her eyes stared at me wide open as her remaining tears in her eyes runs down her cold cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done the whole crowd cheered. He nodded his head with recognition when I climbed out of the cage. They all run towards me and started telling me that they are amaze that I didn&#39;t need to shift, or I was amazing. But one of them caught my attention. &#34;Murderer.&#34; I stop to find who says that but I couldn&#39;t see who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh Dwayne! You are amazing out there babe!&#34; Sarah rush towards me and gave me a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t believe it! I didn&#39;t expect you to kill them all without even shifting.&#34; She added, I just continue walking and she followed me. When we reach the stage Hunter walk towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pat my shoulders with a huge smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you wouldn&#39;t let me down.&#34; He mumbled, I just nodded my head then he grab my hand and pulled it over my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone I give you the Alpha of the Crescent Moon Pack!&#34; The crowd cheered, but I don&#39;t feel anything but remorse and hatred inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now who ever wants to challenge him feel free to step forward.&#34; He added, I glance at the crowd and they all lower their heads. No one even dare to look me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like no one is interested.&#34; He mumbled, the other Elders just remained silent along with the new and former Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he let me go I quickly went down. Giving the excuse of taking a shower because I was covered with blood. When I reach my room I immediately throw my desk on the wall. I groan out of frustration and started punching the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What that person said earlier was right. I was nothing but a murderer. I remember the way her blue eyes darkens as I took her life away. How I killed Sarah&#39;s mate. And... How I killed Amara in the past. Whoever that person is was right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my clothes off and head to the shower, letting the cold water brush away the blood in my body. The scent of this blood is making my stomach upset. Like I want to throw up. I remain there for who knows how long. I can still hear the crowd from here but I wouldn&#39;t go back there anymore. I couldn&#39;t get myself to stand there. Is this really what they want me to do? An Alpha who doesn&#39;t even give a damn about the life of others? If this is what they want I will give it to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day as I went downstairs everyone who saw me is either greeting me with the Alpha title or are too afraid to speak. Everyone is avoiding me. From what I heard the Elders stayed in the East Mansion. Her belongings was still there but Sarah told me that all of the furnitures and other things there are either thrown away or burned down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reach the place where the celebration was held last night the cage was still there. The body are already gone, they were instructed to display those body right outside the border as a warning for those who tried to cross it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Alpha.&#34; One of the pack member said. It was Renz, a newly shift werewolf. He was Zion&#39;s cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you in awhile Renz.&#34; He scratch his head, he was a few years younger than us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was busy with the training Alpha.&#34; He answered. I nodded my head, not wanting to keep the conversation going and I think he understood me when he excuse his self to help to the removal of the cage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When everyone is busy I started heading back to where I was planning in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop where the dungeon is located, it was an old fortress that was turned into a dungeon. It was turned this way because the fortress itself is like a maze that even if someone successfully escape his cell, he wouldn&#39;t be able to escape from here. Only a few people can actually know the way to the exit. Even some of our pack members are lost around here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reach the inside, it was really dark only the light from the torch is giving a flicker of light in this cold place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness is not an issue for us werewolves so I made my way towards my prospect. When I reach his cell, he was chained both hand and feet. Even his neck was chained with silver spikes around it. That if he tried to shift he will just end up hurting himself or worse kill himself. This will help us to keep him at this state. He was still an Alpha making him someone that we can&#39;t underestimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Took you long enough.&#34; He uttered, he lifted his head. He was covered with bruises. I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t gave him a chance to recover his strength because I said so. I couldn&#39;t let a traitor like him especially after what he have done to just rest here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, your the least person that I wanted to see right now.&#34; He smiled at me. And I know he knew why I&#39;m here.</p>
