                <p>&#34;You were going to let him attack those poor girls. I wasn&#39;t about to let you harm them. Kill me or not, he&#39;ll never get his deviant hands on them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron yelled out, &#34;Chirbon, now!&#34; Pulling Damion&#39;s sword, he pressed it against Claven&#39;s throat, backing him away from Damion who was writhing on the floor. His body moved in strange ways as he let out the worst blood curdling screams-or roars-Gregron had ever heard. &#34;What the hell did you do to him!&#34; Gregron yelled at the fairy who stared as the others grabbed Reniza and Jaquisis, pulling them from their entertainment at sword point and holding them there. Though the second dwarf disappeared. It was Cala, Gareth, and Chirbon. &#34;Whoever&#39;s free, to me, I have to go get the other women lose.&#34; It was Gareth who answered the call. Once Claven was under Gareth&#39;s sword, Gregron got in her face. &#34;Make it stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I can&#39;t!&#34; Tears started streaming down her face. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We came here to see if we could rescue you and the Chiaro&#39;s daughter! The moment Damion heard Gareth&#39;s wife was here, pregnant no less, we knew we had to do something! Without him, we likely won&#39;t make it out of the damn palace! Now use your magic and free him from whatever-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t!&#34; She screamed back, tears flowing. &#34;It was an actual spell. A charm. His mind is lost, his magic will be mine in a few minutes, we&#39;ll have to work with what we have.&#34; Her shoulders slumped as Gregron moved through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s the key!?&#34; Gregron came storming back, grabbing Claven by the hair and pulling him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should have known no one would find you more attractive than me.&#34; Claven spit in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregron brought his leg back, but a hand grabbed his ankle. &#34;NO!&#34; Damion screamed, pulling at him. &#34;Armistice.&#34; He growled, rolling to his side. Gregron got down on his hands and knees beside Damion. &#34;Hurry and go. No. Time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. Anyone know where the key is kept?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman hanging from the wall who looked an awful lot like one the Chiaro folk called out, &#34;It&#39;s usually in his robes! Likely a secret pocket inside the left breast.&#34; Gregron nodded, grabbing the robes. He sighed, holding the key tightly in his hand. He ran in, staring with the Chiaro. &#34;Do you have an extra sword? I&#39;m a warrior and can help fight.&#34; Gregron nodded, handing her Damion&#39;s sword once she was down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see Mary!&#34; Gareth called, he was losing his focus as he looked through the sea of women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll find her, pay attention!&#34; Gregron called back. &#34;Warrior.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Cherbet, Master.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the daughter of Chief Chirbon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where the pregnant girl, Mary is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. You rescue them, I&#39;ll get her.&#34; She moved to another secret room, pulling open a movable wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Cherbet!&#34; Gregron pulled his shirt off and tossed it at her. Most of these women were naked as the day they were born, not dressed like slaves. She nodded, but didn&#39;t put it on. Instead, she wrapped it around whoever she&#39;d found behind the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s too weak, she&#39;s not going to be able to run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gareth called out, &#34;Mary! Love! I&#39;m here.&#34; Her head came up, her green eyes searching for her husband. &#34;I&#39;ll carry her the whole way if I have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Gregron shook his head, going to Gareth as the slaves gathered round. &#34;I can&#39;t fight. It&#39;s too much of a risk for the Kingdom of Thambair. I&#39;ll carry her. I&#39;ll take center for better protection, we won&#39;t take a chance she could be hurt. Cherbet, Chiron, one of you at the front, the other at the back. Gareth, Cala, you&#39;ll take right and left. Fairy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aveline.&#34; She sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fairy, you&#39;re the reason we might not make it, so you keep center with me. Use your magic to keep the soldiers and Council off us. I expect you to take his place.&#34; Gregron said angrily pointing at Damion, who&#39;s screams only continued to grow worse. &#34;I thought you said you&#39;d have control of his magic soon. When is that going to happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It already should have. I don&#39;t know it&#39;s never not worked before. But&#34; she worried her lip. Gregron threw his hands up then stared at her, waiting for an answer. &#34;Well, it&#39;s said if the target is truly in love with another, the spell will break, and-well, kill them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Gregron whispered. They were out of time. At some point, the guards would catch on to what was happening. &#34;Damion.&#34; Gregron dropped down again. His eyes were completely black, the black spiderwebs started to wind their way up his arms and neck. Further now than Gregron had seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damion&#39;s arm shot out hitting him in the center of the chest. As he fell back, Damion got to his hands and knees and let out a god awful roar. &#34;What is that!&#34; Gareth yelled. Looking over. Damion&#39;s skin started to boil, and soon it was ink black from fingertip to elbow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing good! Let&#39;s go!&#34; Reaching down, Gregron tried to get the coursebine pendant out of Damion&#39;s hair, but just couldn&#39;t. Eventually, he grabbed his danger, cutting it away with half of Damion&#39;s hair. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; He whispered, standing he went to Mary, wrapping her in Claven&#39;s robes, he pulled her into his chest. &#34;Here, keep them in the sheath until it&#39;s time, only use them if you must.&#34; Handing her six weighted throwing knives. &#34;Head toward the Tower of Mirrors. We need to go to Thambair. If they follow us, there&#39;s a whole army standing at the ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aveline turned pale. &#34;You came here, knowing you were going to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And you&#39;re the one who will be explaining to Princess Volencia why her beloved couldn&#39;t come home.&#34; Gregron glared at her, but this was no time to fight. &#34;Everyone, listen well. We&#39;re going to get out of here. Chirbon, you know the way?&#34; He grunted nodding, putting himself at the fore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I leave the front, it will be to protect the rest of you, who will take lead?&#34; Chirbon looked at the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; Gareth agreed. &#34;I know the way. How many mirrors up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five.&#34; Gregron answered automatically. &#34;You all hear that? Worse comes to worse, get to the mirrors, the Princess in Thambair will help all of you. She&#39;s waiting for us even now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve broken the Armistace. I will come for you.&#34; Claven growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve broken nothing. Not one of Volencia&#39;s folk have threatened you today. We do not wage war. These are not my men, and they are not of Thambair. Holding their wives and daughters hostage? This was your own doing. We&#39;re only here with support. Besides, you had Damion in your hairs all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damion doesn&#39;t count you idiot.&#34; Claven said, smiling. &#34;He&#39;ll die here, and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then he gave his life to them. There&#39;s no better heroism than that.&#34; Gregron looked at Damion. Something told him he wasn&#39;t going to be dead and gone. No. Something much worse was coming, and they needed to move. Now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seventy-six</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in Thambair, Volencia and Venron hadn&#39;t left the throne room. Her father had sent for Gregron&#39;s Lieutenant General. Orders were given, and the in less two hours, the entire army was ready for the back lash of what Damion was likely doing at this moment. Volencia paced in front of her father&#39;s throne. Only sitting when he became so irritated with her that he yelled for her to stop. From there, she would sit for a while before continuing to pace. She knew that it was going to be a long and arduous ordeal, but the longer they were gone, the more anxious she became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, how much longer do you think it&#39;s going to take? I don&#39;t how much longer I can take this.&#34; Volencia asked, chewing on her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to have to love. And asking me the same question constantly isn&#39;t going to change that.&#34; Venron looked up from the book he was reading. &#34;We&#39;re ready for whatever will come. You aren&#39;t going to be able to change the outcome. Sit down and relax. It&#39;ll be better for you and the baby, Dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia threw her hands in the air in exacerbation. &#34;Not all of them, Father. What will I do if something happens to them? I can&#39;t live without him. I already know I can&#39;t do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. So you&#39;ve said. A hundred times. You&#39;ll just have to trust them.&#34; Venron tucked his nose back in the book trying to avoid her ranting. &#34;Damion will do just fine and will be back soon. So, will Gregron.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you just sit there and act like nothing is happening?&#34; Volencia asked, plopping down on her mother&#39;s throne beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve had fifty horrible years of practice darling.&#34; This time, he didn&#39;t even lift his nose from the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia craned her neck to see what he was reading. &#34;What is that?&#34; Shrugging, Venron lifted the immaculate black cover up so that she could see the book. He stared at her too long, and she suddenly remembered, he couldn&#39;t say everything he wanted. It was Necron&#39;s book. &#34;Oh. I wish you could tell me about it.&#34; Her shoulders slumped and she let her head fall back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; Venron said, not looking at her. He&#39;d gotten good at making small, non-committal comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t it kill you that there&#39;s nothing we can do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It does. But wait we must.&#34; He said it just as the words were leaving her mouth. He already knew everything she would complain about and more. And even this conversation was stalling. &#34;You get used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never want to get used to this feeling.&#34; Volencia pouted. Crossing her arms over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yaron, Lieutenant General of their army burst through the door and walked up to them, bowing as he reached the steps leading up to the dais. &#34;Your Majesty, a blue lizard showed up at the gates. I know we&#39;re not supposed to let anyone in, but Damion described his brother, in detail, and I thought you should know that this lizard is on his way to the castle. I can stop him if you want me to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;  Volencia jumped from her seat, bouncing. &#34;Let him come. His name is Travion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lieutenant nodded. &#34;Correct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to see him.&#34; She couldn&#39;t help it, she started pacing again. &#34;He&#39;s my brother.&#34; The Lieutenant locked eyes with her. &#34;Damion&#39;s brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; He nodded. Turning on his heels. &#34;He&#39;ll be here shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Volencia stepped down from the dais. &#34;I need to know what&#39;s going on out there.&#34; Yaron stopped, turning to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your brother will be here soon. I want to get back.&#34; Yaron nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volencia turned to her father. &#34;I&#39;m going with him. If Travion is here, that must mean something.&#34; Venron looked at her in surprise but nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will be good for you to focus on something else for a while. Lieutenant, I expect you to stay with the Princess and escort her back here with Damion&#39;s brother.&#34; Volencia grabbed Damion&#39;s sword, buckling it around her hip. Her father watched her curiously, while Yaron remained impassive. If there was anyone in Rhelia more serious than Gregron, it was the Lieutenant. As she pressed on her gown, walking forward, Yaron fell into step behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s coming through the main entrance, correct?&#34; Volencia asked over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Your Highness.&#34; Pulling her skirts up, she raced down the stairs. She was so excited to see Travion. Especially right now. She would need his support if things didn&#39;t go as planned. A warm comfortable feeling curled in her chest as she flew out the front doors and saw him striding through the gates onto the castle grounds. Unlike when they were in Samanthia, today, he wore full pants, a large black tunic, and specially designed boots that covered his legs up to his knees. Volencia hadn&#39;t realized they had formal wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering to keep some decorum, she stopped at the top of the stairs to wait for him. At first she bounced on her toes with excitement. But she felt a heat welling up, as cold sweats broke out over her skin. Shaking it off as nerves, she breathed in deeply. That was a mistake. Her lungs felt like they were on fire. As her vision narrowed into a pinpoint tunnel, she swayed. Knees giving out, she felt herself falling, and strong arms wrapped around her as a male&#39;s voice hollered orders. She didn&#39;t know if she had actually fallen and gotten hurt, or what was happening, but pain seeped into every pour and tore at every nerve. The last thing she saw was Travion running toward them. As blackness crowded her vision, everything else was drown out by the screams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>* * * *</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Volencia finally came too again, she was cradled in Travion&#39;s arms. Her entire body shook in pain. It still felt like fire ran through her veins, but it was all starting to ebb as soldiers bustled around the room, trying to bring in a seat big enough for Travion. &#34;Are you okay?&#34; He asked softly, his large free hand pushing the hair from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; She squirmed. &#34;No. Something wrong!&#34; She clung to his shirt. &#34;Damion, he&#39;s in pain. He needs our help.&#34; Travion&#39;s thumb caressed her cheek, wiping her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I&#39;ve seen this happen to him before. He&#39;s going to be fine. His safety isn&#39;t what I would be concerned with. It&#39;s those who are about to cross his path.&#34; The pad of his large thumb wiped the tears from her cheek as she squirmed in his arm. That he could hold her perfectly fine with just one arm was alarming, because he wasn&#39;t letting her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you don&#39;t understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do, Volencia.&#34; The soldiers all around them bristled at him using her actual name, exchanging glances and watching them from the corner of their eyes. &#34;There&#39;s a darkness in him, and it&#39;s coming out. Trust me. I&#39;ve seen it more times than I cared for. It&#39;s dangerous and I can&#39;t let you go to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to go help him!&#34; Volencia squirmed again, fighting to get out of Trey&#39;s arms. A few of the soldiers looked like they were about to try to interfere. Not used to allowing anyone to man handle their princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Venron stood, waving at them to stand down. &#34;Daughter, you need to listen. I&#39;m sure if Travion thought Damion was in danger, he would be more than willing to go after him. If it&#39;s safer to stay here and wait, then that is what you will do. You have more to think about than just him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t just wait here!&#34; She screamed, slapping Travion, &#34;Put me down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re reminding me of Lenny throwing a tantrum because he&#39;s not getting what he wants. Which means, until you settle down, the answer is no.&#34; Trey&#39;s voice was hard as he held onto her. &#34;What are you going to do? Run into enemy territory when you don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on? Damion can hold his own. Relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have every idea!&#34; Trey shouted, Volencia froze in fear and shock. She&#39;d not once heard him raise his voice while she was in Samanthia. &#34;What I don&#39;t understand is how you could possibly know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were wearing coursbine to connect us. He said that if he called to me through it, it meant he needed help!&#34; She pushed at the blue lizard&#39;s chest, still squirming and doing everything she could to get out of his arms. &#34;He&#39;s calling for me! I may be the only one who can do anything!&#34; Tears were still streaming down her cheeks and she just wanted to get to him. She knew something was wrong, and she had to do something. &#34;Trey, please. Please let me go. I&#39;m begging you. I need to know he&#39;s okay. I can&#39;t-I can&#39;t do this without him. What if he doesn&#39;t come home because I didn&#39;t go to him? Trey? I need to go!&#34;</p>
