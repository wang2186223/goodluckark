                <p>When the light of dawn shone on my face, I kept staring at the window, annoyed that it was morning already and I haven&#39;t fallen asleep like I wanted to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the echo of a soft knock drew my attention towards the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I mumbled, focusing back on the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Nero walked into the room, gazed at me, and said, &#34;Come downstairs to eat. I made breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for a few seconds, I threw the bedspread off me and got out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I stopped in front of Nero, and although I wanted to be mad at him, I didn&#39;t know how to act because the flashes of memories from last night kept torturing me every time I stared at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of the way his hand traced against my bare skin caused me to pause, feeling nervous that he might sense that I was getting heated again and that I was yearning for his manly hands to drive me insane like last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An omega heat lasts for four to seven days so if you need my shirt, you can take a few,&#34; Nero said, staring into my darting eyes. &#34;Unmated Omegas have many options to get relief&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t!&#34; I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then without uttering a word to Nero, I walked past him and headed out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of minutes later, when we both arrived in the dining room, I frowned at the cereal box, the milk jar, and two bowls on the table. Then I glared at him and said, &#34;You said that you made breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you staring at?&#34; Nero calmly uttered, pulling a chair out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he sat down, I pouted, and then I took my seat, pulling the bowl towards me as I blurted out, &#34;And here I thought you cooked something fancy, causing my poor heart to beat like crazy because I thought it was sexy that you can cook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry to disappoint you, princess.&#34; Nero casually said as he pulled his milk into his bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged, I aggressively tossed the spoon into my bowl and harshly said, &#34;Don&#39;t call me, princess! I&#39;m not a princess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It fell awkwardly silent between us, and I felt my heart sink when I noticed the way Nero looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just please don&#39;t call me that,&#34; I mumbled, reaching for the box of cereal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get your injury yesterday?&#34; Nero asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Karen and her stupid followers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that. I meant the morning we met. You had bloodstains on your hands and sweater.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of sadness choked me and I felt a bit suffocated as I grabbed the milk jar, opened it, and dumped it into my bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I hit the jar on the table and said, &#34;My dad. Thankfully, I can heal faster, so at least my DNA didn&#39;t screw me up completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I was trying to fight my urge to cry as I took a spoonful of the cereal, as I chomped on it, I felt my tears trailing down my face, and I aggressively sniffed, striving to pull myself together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable! Nero sat there in silence watching me break down and cried my eyes out like some pathetic soul which I was. But still, not even consoling me! How cold can he get!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Nero finally mumbled when our gaze met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m used to being the black sheep of the family.&#34; I whispered, drying my face with the back of my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of breakfast happened in silence, and after we got through eating, I was about to pick up his and my empty bowl when Nero said, &#34;Leave it. We are running late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To go where?&#34; I blurted out without thinking for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a student at the school that I teach at, and I have to get to class and so do you,&#34; Nero said, raising his brow. &#34;We need to get you some clothes. You can not show up on campus in my t-shirt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear that I had long forgotten over the night finally resurfaced and my heart started to be pounded in my chest, violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to go back to school or home,&#34; I mumbled, taking two unstable steps backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that&#39;s going to be a problem. I have to take you back. I bet, your family is looking for you!&#34; Nero said, glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the dining room suddenly felt suffocating as I tried to breathe, and my breath got shallow by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t take me back.&#34; I cried as I tightened my fist, feeling my nails in the skin of my palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, you gotta go home! I can not keep you in my place!&#34; Nero said, frowning at me. &#34;Helping you was just a one-time thing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling of panic suddenly overcame me, raising the fine hairs on the back of my neck as I listened to my heartbeat pounding in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I subconsciously took a step back and screamed while crying my eyes out, &#34;He will hurt me, really bad, or worse! Please, let me stay here. I can cook, clean, and I can do whatever you ask of me. I beg you to not take me back to that monster!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are young! You can&#39;t spend your life hiding away in my house!&#34; Nero said as a look of confusion settled on his face while watching the tears pour down my chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, then please help me escape! I promise that once I&#39;m out of the state, I won&#39;t bother you anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Blake! I came here to get a fresh start and not to entangle myself with you or your family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardening his face, Nero frowned and coldly uttered as his eyes turned red, &#34;You are going to school, and that&#39;s final!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a split second, I felt a dominant force awaken in me that I have only started to feel since yesterday, and even though I was still in doubt about it, a part of me knew that it was my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going.&#34; I coldly said as my wolf became aggressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you are!&#34; Nero harshly uttered without taking his sight off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I knew that I would never harm a hair on his head, he seemed alarmed, and I felt confused that an alpha will get alerted by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud cry escaped my lips as I felt a piercing pain in my fingers, and I looked at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, my eyes widened as I realized that my fingernails were transforming into claws, and my only thought was, &#39;What the fuck!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next agony I felt was just brutal, and I screamed, feeling like every bone in my body was dislocating itself and my inside wrenching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, it hurts!&#34; I screamed. &#34;It hurt so bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The full moon is around the corner, and your wolf is being triggered by that.&#34; Nero softly uttered, &#34;Take in a deep breath, Blake. Breathe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I was freaking out and in some severe pain, I fixed my eyes on his as they glowed red, and he commanded, &#34;Inhale in deeply, and then let the air out slowly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the blistering energy and pain shredding through my body started to subside as I breathed in and out without breaking eye contact with Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown flickered crossed Nero&#39;s forehead and the glow in his eyes died down as he watched me as I slowly became calmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling weak, I dropped to the ground, on my knees, and looked up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is happening to me!&#34; I cried as I stared at my claws transform back to normal fingernails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, Nero rushed to me. Then he squatted and asked, &#34;You are a half-blood, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I mumbled, looking into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Half-blooded werewolves usually shift late around eighteen. Some do not shift at all even though their werewolf genes are dominant. But apparently, you are just a late shifter and not wolfless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can shift?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding at me as I smiled happily at him, Nero playfully caressed his fingers through my hair and said, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he looked into my eyes, and then, after a couple of minutes had passed, he held my hand as his eyes shifted red and then softly uttered, &#34;You got to go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But my father hates me and so does my pack!&#34; I mumbled, striving to restrain my emotions. &#34;I asked you yesterday not to carry me to the hospital, and instead, take me to your house because I was afraid of my father finding out that I&#39;m hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching my jaws, I withdrew my hand out of Nero&#39;s grip and then said, &#34;He will send me to &#39;The Night&#39; if I go back, or worse because I have been away from home for a day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does your father hate you?&#34; Nero asked after keeping silent for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving myself a second to think, I sighed and then mumbled, &#34;Because I&#39;m wolfless... Well, because he thinks that I&#39;m wolfless and worthless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling at me, Nero locked eyes with me and said, &#34;Right! But you are not wolfless anymore. You are now everything he ever wanted, so&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, he has no reason to cast me aside anymore, beat on me, or allow the pack to ill-treat me,&#34; I said with a lifeless tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Nero looked hesitant, and I became a bit hopeful that he might just change his mind and allow me to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Your wolf is awakening, and you need the help of your pack to go through the process successfully because the first time you shift, it&#39;s painful and it will take some time for you to get your wolf under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m ready to go back to school and home,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I hated every word that I had just uttered, I knew that Nero wanted to get rid of me, and realizing that he honestly didn&#39;t want me as his mate, I didn&#39;t want to force what wasn&#39;t meant to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes after I got dressed at a boutique downtown, Nero drove us into the school parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he brought the car to a stop, I took a long look at him as he pulled out his key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when he swayed his gaze to me, I beamed at him and heartily uttered, &#34;Thank you for everything, Mr. Fang!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what teachers are for, right?&#34; Nero said, looking into my eyes. &#34;To help their students who need them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on my lip faded, and I half-heartedly mumbled, &#34;Right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I drew a deep breath and said, &#34;From today onward, I will treat you as nothing but my instructor even though it will be hard for me. Count it as my way of thanking you for your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nero said nothing, I pushed the car door open and got down, wearing ripped loose jeans and an oversized yellow t-shirt with my hair in a simple ponytail and a black bag on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for Nero, I hurried towards the school building while fighting back tears as I thought, &#39;This is for the best, so you need to get over him! You can do this!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Rogue</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking over to the back of the class, I put threw my bag on the desk, sat down, and relaxed in the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly a frown surfaced on my face as I stared at Nero walking into the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, my gaze rested on Karen as she sat in the seat beside me, and anger spiked inside of me while I clutched my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Karen turned around, gazed at me, and cheerfully said, &#34;Good morning, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your sense of shame, talking to me after what you did?&#34; I harshly uttered, glaring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pitiful look settled on Karen&#39;s face as she pouted and said, &#34;Someone is moody this morning. Sorry if greeting you was that offensive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; I mumbled, drawing my brows together in a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I swayed my gaze at Nero, and he slightly frowned at me. But that didn&#39;t stop me from glaring back at Karen, and coldly uttering, &#34; Don&#39;t play dumb with me. You know what you did, and soon enough, the school board will find out too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without replying, Karen wrote on a piece of paper, and then passed it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I didn&#39;t want to accept it, I took the sheet and silently read it, &#34;I know that you left the campus in Mr. Fang&#39;s car, and if you don&#39;t want him to get into trouble, you will keep your hole shut!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like time froze for a moment as I solely stared at Nero, knowing that if my father found out that I stayed at his place, he would hurt him, or worse kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my gaze off Nero, I took the paper and stuffed it into my bag. Then I frowned and gave the middle finger when Karen turned around and stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as I swayed my gaze towards the doorway. But fear ceased my body as I stared at my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I laid my head flat on the desk, hiding my face behind my bookbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running away from home!? You got guts, brat!&#34; I heard Loki coldly uttered. &#34;Are you going to come down here, or should I come there for you!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his voice, I could tell that he was infuriated, and not wanting to test his unstable patience, I stood to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to steady my breath and calm the panic rising in me, my eyes unintentionally stared at my father, and fear immediately damaged the calmness that I tried so hard to maintain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Calm down, Blake. Once he knows that your wolf is awakening, everything will change for the better. You just have to make him understand.&#39; I cried in her head as she walked away from her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached the front of the class, I stopped before my father, and the moment I met his icy eyes, a sense of distress rushed through me and I clutched my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire class grew silent, and I just knew that they all were waiting anxiously for what was going to happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I can explain!&#34; I cried out of fear, pushing my nail into the skin of my palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word, Loki viciously hit me in the face with the back of his hand, and I lost my balance and dropped to the floor, staring at the blood from my nose dripping on the tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little bitch didn&#39;t I warn you to stay in line this semester!&#34; Loki shouted as he scowled down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising my head, I gazed into his cold eyes and felt a raw wave of a mixture of anger and fear wash over me as the hairs rose on the back of my neck and my mouth ran dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I suppressed it all in and whispered, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry! Wow! She is sorry!&#34; Loki shouted, folding his fingers into a fist, &#34;Do you know how troublesome it was to look for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to stay away from home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really! Then where the hell was you yesterday?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears running down my face, I choked back my cry as I fought against my urge to look at Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I drew a deep breath, stood from the floor, and mumbled, &#34;I missed the school bus, and I was afraid that you would get mad at me, so I stayed at a motel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A motel?&#34; Loki mumbled in confusion. &#34;How did you get the money to book a motel room?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing intensely at me, his face suddenly ravaged with rage as he looked me dead in the eyes and firmly asked, &#34;Who are you messing around with?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one!&#34; I whispered, gazing down at my shoes. &#34;I swear that I was alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not holding back, Loki viciously smacked my face, causing my head to veer around to the left, and then shouted, &#34;You little lying bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I heard Nero&#39;s voice,  &#34;Mr. Hayes, you are disrupting my class! So can you take this somewhere else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the fuck do you think you are to speak to me in such a tone!&#34; Loki coldly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I looked back at Nero and slightly shook my head, knowing what my father was capable of doing to anyone that dared cross him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Nero gazed into my eyes. Then he looked back at Loki and said, &#34;My bad for speaking out of term.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his brows, Loki gave him an icy stare and firmly said, &#34;The next time you speak to me in such a tone, I will put a hold inside your chest and rip your heart out! Got it!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I watched Nero&#39;s eyes darken as he nodded, and when I look back at Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good!&#34; Loki said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he focused back on me and harshly uttered, &#34;You can forget coming back to school for the next one month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I was striving my best to stay calm, I immediately started to freak out when I heard those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad please,&#34; I whispered, hearing my heartbeat pounding in my ear. &#34;I don&#39;t want to go to that place. I won&#39;t go back to that place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze unintentionally rested on Loki&#39;s soulless eyes, and I swallowed hard as he approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was only a foot away from me, he raised his hand and viciously slammed his palm against my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you are to tell me what you would do and wouldn&#39;t do!&#34; Loki coldly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Loki gave me a hard look and said, &#34;I despise having the disappointment of a daughter like you! Maybe a few weeks in &#39;The Night&#39; will make you learn your place in the pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep sense of anger held me captive as the pain from Loki&#39;s hit surged through me, and I tightened my fists, lowering my gaze to the tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not going,&#34; I whispered, raising my gaze to stare at Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I tell you to do something, you do it and shut the fuck up!&#34; Loki screamed, staring coldly into my eyes. &#34;Now, walk ahead of me, and let&#39;s go home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t comply, Loki seized me by the arm and yanked me along with him. But I fought back, struggling to pull my hand from his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My action made Loki vex, and he forcefully swung me, causing me to lose my balance and crashed into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the pain ripped through my body, I hurriedly crawled into the corner and pulled my knees against my chest. Then I hugged my legs tightly as the blood from my nose dripped onto my jeans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of hopelessness left me numb shaking, and my heart froze for a second as I ushered my eyelid shut and allowed my tears to soak upon my bloodstained face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, raw anger awakened in me, and I pushed aside my fear as I struggled to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will rather be a lone wolf than stay in a pack that treats me like a piece of shit!&#34; I screamed, looking my father dead in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh escaped Loki&#39;s lips. Then his expression grew cold as he said, &#34;You don&#39;t want to cross that line! Trust me, your ass will be dead within a matter of days!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A dead hybrid is better than the one who spent her days in anguish, tortured by the very ones who should protect her!&#34; I loudly uttered. &#34;So go ahead, father, do the honor and denounce me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare test my patience!&#34; Loki coldly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t react or say something, he let out a loud growl of annoyance and then approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insanity in his eyes sent chills down my spine. But I kept still with my hands tightened into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your stubbornness will be the death of you!&#34; Loki coldly uttered without taking his eyes off me. &#34;You are dead to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned away from me, gazed at the faces of those in the class, and firmly uttered, &#34;From today onward, Blake Hayes will no longer be known as my daughter or a member of the Dark moonlight pack. From now till forever, she will be recognized by this pack as a rogue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his remark, Loki stormed out of the classroom with Alaska, and for a moment, I looked at his back fade out the door. Then I hung my head and sadly thought, &#39;What have I done?&#39;</p>
