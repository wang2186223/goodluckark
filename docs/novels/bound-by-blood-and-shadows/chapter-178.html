You are my only family.&#34; He brushed a hand over her hair. &#34;You are all I have left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that said, he turned away and left her in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected many things, but not that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The death of a mate, fated or chosen, was never something that could be received calmly, except if the thing he had called Lord Rosil for had worked. Except, if the King&#39;s heart was truly frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly looked through the letter. There wasn&#39;t much information there besides what the King had said. She wasn&#39;t able to get far then in disclosing their secret then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That dirty traitor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could smell the fur creature&#39;s blood and she saw some flakes of ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile blossomed on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dead. Along with those abominations she carried in her womb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura frowned, remembering the wolf&#39;s pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back in the direction her brother had disappeared to some moments earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart must truly be frozen, for he wasn&#39;t grieving the death of his mate, nor was he grieving the death of his unborn family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This would be easier than she thought, because despite how frozen his heart was, he still recognized her as his only family, the only person he could trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This ambush might as well be declared won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For tonight, she would conduct a fake search for a traitor. After that, she would return to her room not to arouse suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow night, the transfer of her mother would happen, and the ambush would begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this time tomorrow, Lavida would be theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time moved fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before Laura would know it, it was tomorrow night already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Delice was trapped on the altar, her body getting prepared for The Mother&#39;s soul to take full control of her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every member of the White Circle watched as Laura walked around her and repeated the process of the chanting and the sprinkling of the liquid all over again, the Mother chanting spells along with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver watched too, his eyes fixed on Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura stepped aside and pulled out the enchanted sword from her sheath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Sword of Change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Laura would dig it into Delice&#39;s stomach, her soul would be forced into the hands of death and the Mother could take over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the ambush would happen tonight. Once the Mother would find a body, there would be no use for waiting. She would bring this castle to the ground. She, the Volakys at her command and all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were all hers, including her loyal daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura started moving closer to Delice, chanting once again, spells that The Mother took part in with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver watched her closely, then his eyes shifted to Delice. He balled his fists slowly by his sides. He wanted to look away but he couldn&#39;t, he just couldn&#39;t do anything but watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Sweet Bun didn&#39;t deserve this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too sweet for this cruel castle, this cruel Kingdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; someone yelled from one of the balconies before the body fell to the ground, eyes rolled back with only white left behind, and a hole where his heart should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, many more screams filled the air and from the chaos emerged the King, inked lines running up his face, blood dripping from his claws and anger in his eyes that were looking straight at her as he yanked out the heart of another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This looked nothing like someone with a frozen heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He- he had tricked her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been ambushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother?&#34; Laura gritted in pain as she called out for her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ball of smoke sank straight into Delice, her eyelids shot open, an absolute darkness taking over her eyes and she gritted in pain as the Mother&#39;s soul forced itself into her body, wrestling against her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possession hadn&#39;t been done right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This would have consequences later, but for now, this must be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother?!&#34; Laura yelled once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Volakys joined the battle at Mother&#39;s command, but she couldn&#39;t stay here for long, the possession had to be done right for her to be in full control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she created a portal to the place she felt most connected to, and pulled her daughter along, who still had the enchanted sword with her. Oliver jumped through the portal too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Escaping for his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tumbled into the Hall of Statues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice stood up quickly, her hands going to either side of her head, as the color of her eyes changed from one to another in seconds, depending on who was holding control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood dropped from her nose, and she staggered to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*My -medallion. Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother!&#34; Laura pulled her back to dig the sword into her stomach, but she yanked herself away from Laura&#39;s grip, and threw her against a statue with a strength she shouldn&#39;t even have if the Mother&#39;s Soul wasn&#39;t inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I AM NOT YOUR MOTHER!&#34; She yelled and raced to Laura before she could stand on her feet. Madness consumed her aura and slammed Laura&#39;s head with the broken pieces of the statue, until there was nothing left of her head but a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dug her claws into her chest and yanked her heart out. She tossed it on the floor, wiping away the blood that had splattered on her face away as she stared down at her &#34;friend&#34; that she had now killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Oliver hugged her from behind and the enchanted sword went straight through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned black immediately and the screams of grief from The Mother rang through Delice&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>187 - White Flag</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That word would be a great understatement to describe how Delice was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like her non-functional heart had been ripped out of her as the blade tore through her stomach, entering through one side and reappearing in another before sinking into Oliver, who held her firmly from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her soul was dwindling and she could feel her body getting possessed completely by the Mother. She looked back at Oliver with tears in her eyes, regretting the first time she had met him, wishing they had never crossed paths while she thought of her daughter and the time she would never have with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iaccept!&#34; Oliver yelled as blood drizzled down his mouth. He pulled the sword away and Delice slipped to the floor, bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the weight of something pull out of her, leaving her completely weak. Her sight was getting blurry and her gaze was fixed on Oliver as he staggered to the statues while his eyes blackened. The sword slipped away from his grip and hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tumbled to a statue, a sly smirk on his face, blood dripping from the corner of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrong-vessel,&#34; he muttered, until his eyes went completely black and he started saying some unintelligible words, those were certainly not his words but the Mothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zirus,&#34; she muttered as she slipped to the ground. The darkness in Oliver&#39;s eyes disappeared. Just like he had thought, his vessel hadn&#39;t been prepared to allow the mother in, neither was he a compatible match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was gone but at the cost of his soul embracing death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied smile tugged up the corners of his lips as he took one last look at his Sweet Bun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice tried to crawl to Oliver so that she could help him, but she was too weak and bleeding too much to even move. She couldn&#39;t even speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stab had affected her healing abilities, or maybe it was what Laura had done to her that had affected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t die like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What about Mira?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What about her Medallion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was slipping further away into unconscious or maybe death, when she felt someone lift her off the ground, and in the moment, canines sank into her neck.</p>

                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smeared with blood and green liquid that evidenced the death of the newly created Volakys and the White Circle, Valerick walked to the door that had on its other side, his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blank inked lines designed every opening that his ripped cloth left uncovered, the death he had unleashed played repeatedly in his mind. Finding the corpse and almost dismembered body of his sister did not faze him either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All enemies deserved death, even if those enemies were once family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His father had taught him that, and he had learnt well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hurried steps were guided with determination, his mind filled with only one thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted her right now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Needed her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her sins were forgiven. What was the use of their fighting, anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty!&#34; Irysi said as he approached the door. She looked over his shoulder to find Nicholas, but she found no one. Her heart sank with worry and her eyes clouded with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to each their own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of the way,&#34; Valerick commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot-&#34; her words stilled with his glare and she moved away from his path, and he pushed the door open immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi turned to the door mid-pace and the tears that had welled up in her eyes rolled down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands ached to touch him, she itched to go to him but she knew he would push her away. His frozen heart felt nothing for her and as much as the bond between them was filled with many emotions, she knew he could feel none of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart was frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nothing to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You came back. Alive.&#34; she smiled. &#34;You came back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, she hadn&#39;t thought that he would listen to her. After Gwen had told her about Lord Rosil&#39;s presence in the Castle and what Valerick had instructed her to do, Zezi couldn&#39;t help but risk telling Valerick about the White Circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the last straw. She was afraid that Valerick would keep distracting himself with the thoughts of trying not to feel anything for her until the White Circle would launch their ambush and they would all be dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Valerick dying had been so heartbreaking that she decided to write down a letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just like Riza, she didn&#39;t get far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick found her bleeding and her blood turning to flakes of ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had begged him with tears in her eyes to trust her and just do as she said. Having found her in this state, Valerick listened to what she had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told him to tell the Princess that she was dead, told him to go to a certain place in the Castle and attack anyone he found there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she didn&#39;t directly betray the oath, she only gave him instructions, and he followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a loophole that she exploited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the blood and green liquid that were smeared all over him, it was obvious that he had listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had obeyed her; despite everything she had done, he had trusted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t deserve him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the consequences of her actions were here. He would forever watch her with soulless eyes and the mate she once knew would be gone forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her punishment and she was ready to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would never forgive herself for depriving her children of the father they would have had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Heartbeat.&#34; He came closer until he stopped right in front of her. &#34;My Soul.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, sensing the foreign overwhelming emotions that rushed through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart was frozen!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms went around her and she froze, while he rested his chin over her shoulder, her bump having the most contact with his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While I fought, I thought of the home I wanted to return to. It was you, over and over again. You and our babies.&#34; He paused, breathing her in. &#34;I can&#39;t fight you any longer, I can&#39;t stay angry at you any more. I can&#39;t do this anymore. I don&#39;t want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valer-&#34; Tears cut her word shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The more I hurt you, the greater I hurt me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down her cheeks. It was hard to think when she was feeling so many things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Zezi. I love you so much my heart refuses to freeze. Will you please go back to being in love with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick, I never stopped.&#34; Her hands went around him, and she wept as his grip around her tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>188 - History Will Not Repeat Itself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revolution had been defeated and peace reigned, for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bond between Zezi and Valerick was no longer strained with depression, tensed feelings and overwhelming sadness. It blossomed with happiness, an electric feeling that made they both feel alive. The weight of the pregnancy felt so light for Zezi and Valerick&#39;s happiness returned now that their conflict was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was good that the heart-freezing thing hadn&#39;t worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To live his life without having feelings for Zezi and his bats would have been absolute horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had he even ever considered doing that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, they didn&#39;t speak much. They just laid in bed, in each other&#39;s arms and fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the most wonderful night they had both had in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Valerick was gone for a meeting, after pressing a kiss to her head with a promise that he would be back soon. Gwen came into the room next, happiness radiating all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her and her group were at it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some think the twins will be more of bats. Some others think they will be more of wolves but I think they will take both equally. I can&#39;t wait!&#34; She squealed excitedly while she set her a bowl of soup and two other plates of food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Lady&#39;s appetite had really grown. Also, any minute now she would request for a weird combination of food, Gwen couldn&#39;t wait to find out what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Queen just reminded her so much about her while she was pregnant. After eight bats, her mate wanted them to have another. She wanted one too and seeing her Mistress pregnant, reminded her of that desire. She would have a bat so that her Queen&#39;s bats would have a friend of their age to play with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen presented the gift her bats had prepared for the Queen, once again. One of these days, Zezi would have to send one back. She wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are all invited to the birth celebration of my pups. I honestly cannot wait to meet them all!&#34; Zezi declared with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen thanked her and they continued their discussions, as she directed Zezi&#39;s exercises and talked her though what she might experience during childbirth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Zezi went to see Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, how she had missed her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy!&#34; Mira had been so happy to see her, she flew so fast into Zezi&#39;s arms, she almost couldn&#39;t catch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my baby. I have missed you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you too, Mummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have all missed you.&#34; Delice said as she approached them. They had been the only ones in the room before Zezi stepped in. It was good to see that they were getting closer. Delice deserved to be happy after all these years that she had been without her medallion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be gentle with Mummy, she is pregnant.&#34; Delice stated, helping Mira down. Zezi was grateful for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any added weight at this point felt too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira got down and hurried away to get her some letters she had written to her while she was away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so good to see Mira running around like that, to see her healthy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the fastest pregnancy I have ever seen.&#34; Delice could not help but declare in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is what Nicholas said, I think soul-seizers grow very fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice touched her baby bump and there was a kick, she pulled her hand away so fast. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem.&#34; Zezi looked around for where to sit. &#34;I heard you killed Laura.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick had told her that this morning. The White Circle had also been completely destroyed. Zezi was stunned but at the same time, it felt expected. Delice had always had a tinge of craziness in her aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They wanted to use me as a body for The Mother. She was manipulating me--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi pulled her into an embrace. &#34;I am so proud of you. You are free, finally. We should celebrate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Delice&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not think so, Zezi. The price of my freedom seems hefty. Akeem is dead and Oliver took my place. I have killed three to survive, it seems too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi pulled away and waved her hand aside. &#34;You are too selfless for your own good. None of that is your fault, they choose to make that sacrifice. Don&#39;t let their sacrifice go to waste by not living.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George stepped into the room at that moment. Mira rushed to him too but this didn&#39;t seem like the first time she would be seeing him after a long time. He seemed to be in control of himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However the tension that fogged the room with his entrance was unmistakable. He expressed his happiness to see her, as well as mild shock to see how big her baby bump was already, while he completely ignored Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, you have always wanted a child,&#34; His voice didn&#39;t hold as much hatred as it used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi expressed her happiness to see him too, then he left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi promised to get her letters from Mira letter, and she followed George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on? I understand that you do not like vampires but you love your daughter, George. For Mira&#39;s sake, can you at least tolerate her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need your help, Zezi.&#34; He turned to her abruptly, desperation in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King tried to get rid of my mark on you when you first got to the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned. &#34;Where is this heading?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need your help with a medical professional that can help with something like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You marked Delice?&#34; Well no wonder her dress was high collared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was my wolf!&#34; He snapped, then he took in a deep breath. &#34;I want that mark gone. I hate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do that, it could kill her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t care-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;George!&#34; She gripped his shoulders to make him focus. He was losing his mind in anger as usual. &#34;That is the mother of your child. You are not a heartless being, this is not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her gaze for a moment before he pulled away from her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never accept Delice as my mate. They killed my family, Zezi. I watched them. I saw them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is different-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may be able to forgive and carry one of them in your womb willingly but it will always be different with me. When I see her, I see my family&#39;s killer. I&#39;ll get rid of that nasty mark no matter what.&#34; He paused and gave her one last look. &#34;I will never be you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>189 - Another Bond Worth Complications</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold your peace, George.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold your peace?&#34; George raised a brow at her. Even her use of language was starting to sound like them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t his anymore though and he liked to think that he didn&#39;t care about whatever she was getting herself to, but that had come as a shock to him, as much as this rapidly growing baby bump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always wanted a child, at least one of them was getting their heart desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It just didn&#39;t make sense to him how she could be happy with it, but that was none of his damn business! All he wanted to do right now was get rid of the mark on the Bloodsucker or get rid of the Bloodsucker totally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice infuriated him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. If you are such a great judge of things then you will realize that the enemy you are against is dead. Valerick is as much of a victim as we all are. For two centuries, his father and his step mother drained his soul for power. He had to kill his own father, that too at a great sacrifice.&#34; She paused, her heart filling with guilt as she remembered the times she had been against him without knowing the full story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have heard that plenty of times.&#34; He folded his arms across his chest, with a frown on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you seem to have never thought about it. Deeply. Every day he fights against enemies that try to drag us back into the Dark Times, of which I have ignorantly been a part of.&#34; She said the last party quietly. &#34;The sources of our dismay are dead and the rest that live, are merely survivors just as we are. Please, do not hate them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George scoffed. &#34;The Process killed plenty. Your dear mate has his own crimes, don&#39;t try to wash him totally of his sins.&#34; He swept his gaze over her with a glare. &#34;It is a pity that we have come to this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give Delice a chance-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot force me to be in love with a Bloodsucker as you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is forcing you to do that. I&#39;m just saying you should give Delice a chance to be a mother to Mira. Be by her side as Mira&#39;s father. She deserves it, they both deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George gritted his teeth and without a word, he stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice rushed up the hallway shortly after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My baby!&#34; Brightness flooded her face as she threw her arms around Zezi. &#34;They won&#39;t let me see you. I searched everywhere, they told me you were dead- I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wiped the tears away from her face. &#34;I&#39;m alive, Mama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice stepped back, her eyes bulging when she noticed the baby bump. &#34;This is growing fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have them soon.&#34; Zezi chuckled nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice smiled. &#34;I guess, I will be around for more of my grandpups after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi noticed the box that had slipped out of Aunt Alice&#39;s hand when she had seen her earlier, it was laying on the floor. Aunt Alice rushed to pick it up. &#34;It is a box of treatment for Delice.&#34; Before Zezi would have a chance to ask any other question, Aunt Alice provided. &#34;No mother should be deprived of their child. I should know better.&#34; She flashed her a smile. &#34;George will come around. He loves Mira and he will do what is best for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled, tears welling up in her eyes, as she pulled her mother into an embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my baby. Thank you for being alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shouldn&#39;t be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had sworn to herself that she wouldn&#39;t stay too long at the Capital; she had promised herself that her time here would be short, and that she wouldn&#39;t seek him out, afterall, staying away from him was for the best for the both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the heart&#39;s desire was so strong to refuse, even though that said heart was no longer beating and could be considered dead before it ever even lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So here Irysi was, in Nicholas&#39; room, using the spare key he had given her at his arrival in the Capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smelled like the sun, a warmess she couldn&#39;t explain. He smelt like freedom, like the wind in a flowery garden on a sunny afternoon, like a poison she shouldn&#39;t desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their last time at the Province still remained fresh in her mind. She had told him of her mission to come here and marry the King since he clearly didn&#39;t seem to want his mate, she had made it clear to him that she would never be with him. It was best for them to stay apart anyways, they were a curse upon each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A death to the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here she stood in his room, by the door with a bottle of healing medicine in her hand, frozen to a spot because there he was, staring at her with those eyes that always held her captive, with a bandage  wrapped around his lower belly and over his shoulder, disappearing from her sight as it moved to his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Nicholas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her death was looking right at her and all she could feel was this undeniable bond that pulled them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile played on his lips and tears filled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>((Hello, lovely readers. I&#39;m writing a new story for the Spirity Competition.

                <p>190 - Poisonous Darling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tore her gaze away from his own immediately. &#34;You are alive. Good.&#34; She nodded, as nonchalantly as she could with the emotions that clogged her throat, threatening to rip it open and lay all her emotions vulnerable right in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she stepped further into the room and headed for the small table by his bedside. The table was close to where he was seated and it was hard to keep her attention away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension that stretched between them was one that forcefully made its presence known. His scent flooded her lungs and she lingered a second longer within this space because of it. She could feel tears hurting her throat once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just came here to drop this,&#34; the bottle clicked gently against the glass surface of the table. Before she would straight up and turn away, Nicholas hand went over her neck and pulled her face to him, slamming her lips against hers in a possessive and hungry kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything happened so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a swift movement, he had her back against the bed, his lips still pressed against hers; rough and demanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled away from under him quickly, staggering two steps back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nicholas!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were filled with mischief and glee. &#34;You taste just the way I remember, Irysi.&#34; He fisted his hands into the bed, trying to ignore the pain that his wound was sending to his brain due to his recent strenuous activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not allowed to kiss me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; He rose to his feet slowly, ensuring to hold her gaze. Irysi was just as tall as he was, it should be easy to pull her in with either hand- injured or not- and kiss her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t. You are mate, it is only right that-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not let you die just because you can&#39;t stay away from me!&#34; She snapped, her lips still throbbing from their kiss. The spark still flying between them, her body punishing her with the pain after pleasure for not continuing and ensuring that the Mating process was completed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, Irysi, that is my choice to make! Stop making it for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, and folded her arms across her chest. Something weary flickered in her eyes, this wasn&#39;t their first time having this kind of argument but it might be their last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about that weighed against her dead heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Irysi,&#34; his voice softened as he brushed his hand through his curly hair. She wondered  if it would still feel just like she remembered it. She dug her claws into her palms to stop this ache of wanting to touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot dictate how I live or intend to die.&#34; Then his eyes were filled with pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew how much that affected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay with me tonight, Irysi.&#34; He rested his head against her shoulder. &#34;I&#39;m injured, alone, weak. Hmmm, I need you. Will you take care of this injured soldier, Doctor?&#34; He asked in a purr, his voice low, rough and begging. &#34;Hold me, Darling. I&#39;m cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her hands, directing them to go around him in an embrace but she forced them to drop by her sides instead, killing the urge to give him and further fueling his delusion that they could ever be together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was already enough punishment. To have him this close and yet still</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving back for the Province at the break of Dawn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled his head away from her shoulder and looked at her. He didn&#39;t even have to speak, she could see the questions in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My people need me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave when I have healed so I can go after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you always do?&#34; She asked with a smile that had lost its humour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, his gaze concealed. &#34;Like I always do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! It will not be possible this time, Doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor?&#34; He was taken apart by that and he didn&#39;t hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I pronounced a ban on you and you can&#39;t gain entry into the Right Province any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A banishment?!&#34; Finally rage took over his face. &#34;That is ridiculous, Irysi, I have committed no crimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is for your own good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He balled his as he paced back and forth in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you do this to me?&#34; He rushed forward and held her face between his palms in urgency, tears forming in his eyes as his eyeballs danced in their sockets to search her own. &#34;You know I will lose my mind without you? I will go crazy.&#34; He slipped to his knees, hugging her legs as she tried to free herself of his hold over her mentally and physically. It was getting harder and harder not to cry and she didn&#39;t want to cry in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, please have mercy on me. Don&#39;t be so wicked to me, please. I will go insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you will live and that is all that matters!&#34; She bit her lower lip, suppressing her tears once again. &#34;Let me go, Nicholas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has already been done.&#34; He looked up sharply at. &#34;The King has signed it and the declaration has been made.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas rose to his feet, more determination in his eyes than before. &#34;No! I will appeal this. I will go to the King and he will listen to my side and lift the ban. This will not last. Mark my words.&#34; He turned away from her towards the door and she held his hand to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have-&#34; He stole her words away with his lips again but this time pain yanked him away, dragged him to his feet and drew blood from his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>191 - Love Troubles</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain lasted more than it usually would. She couldn&#39;t touch him, it would usually make things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rolled down her cheeks and she reached out for him while instinctively pulling her hands back at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, Nicholas!&#34; She gasped, like she was the one feeling his pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she was the one stretching and grunting on the floor of the room, like she was the one feeling like daggers were being twisted in her stomach, like she was one feeling like she was struggling to breathe even though that was something they had never needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after a long moment of struggle, he was alright again. He wiped the blood away and flashed her a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no need to worry,&#34; he said, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no need to worry? It took longer than usual! You may die if it happens again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iry-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! It is our destiny that our union will bring nothing but death. You might not mind dying from this but I do. I will never forgive myself.&#34; Tears streamed down her face then she wiped them away. &#34;Also, I shall be Joined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joined?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To who? You already have a suitor? How many are they that want your hand? Who is he?&#34; His hand went through his hair roughly. I&#39;m losing my mind, tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone that isn&#39;t you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He mustn&#39;t know you have a mate. I will grant him that knowlegde.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will not meet him. He is in the Province and you are not permitted within the Province any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You are lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Irysi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a determined step back. Unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is farewell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word and without looking back, she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas was left to wallow in his sorrows and fall asleep with his heart full of depression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left the four open, just in case she would come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even wait for dawn, she left that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his window, he watched her carriage leave the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing to be in bed next to Valerick, it helped in many ways but it was something Zezi wasn&#39;t completely used to again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still something between them that served as a wall, something that felt so insignificant, yet so great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was filled with a certain kind of tension, a certain awkwardness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all she had betrayed him, all that just wasn&#39;t going to go away. He had his fill of blood before settling in bed next to her, she had watched him while he did that. He wasn&#39;t saying anything about the meeting he had today, maybe he didn&#39;t trust her any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that she blamed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt no negative feelings from their bibd though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you bury her?&#34; Zezi asked in reference to Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has been burnt along with the others. I will not honor my betrayers in death or while they live, just because they were once my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down her spine at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some minutes passed and all she could do was toss and turn. She couldn&#39;t sleep, her mind was burdened with too many things. Not just that, it wasn&#39;t easy turning with how big her stomach had gotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t help that it was a warm night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just so much heat; she could feel it from inside her body, consuming her and making her go crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to go to the bathroom and lay in the tub but it seemed like a herculean task to even stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything felt difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me.&#34; He lifted her off the bed and carried her to the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so relaxing to be this close to him once, to breathe in his scent of rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took her into the pool with him, and stayed behind her, with his arms prepared to hold her from danger if anything would go wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does it feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It feels like I&#39;m floating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, really laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned. What was so funny about the feeling of floating? Was he testing her? Was she failing? Did this have to do with him trusting her? Once again, was she failing in some way?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swam closer and if she looked down she would see his wavy reflection on the surface of the water as he stood so close to her. The darkness hid his face well and she was scared of turning, afraid of what she would see. The hair on her back rose with fear and goosebumps laced her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on? What was Valerick thinking? What did he have in mind for her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some kind of punishment? Or maybe something worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she still his own or had something changed?</p>
