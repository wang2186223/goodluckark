                <p>Dwayne&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the woman with long black hair, she was standing a few feet away from me. Her back was facing mine so I can&#39;t see her face. The wind blew passed her carrying the scent of vanilla, I even close my eyes to take in the scent. It was a scent that I could never get tired of having. She was wearing a long white nightgown. Like the one I saw in my dream. Am I dreaming again? But why does it feels so real? Like she was real. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten to me but I was hoping that she was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I asked, I couldn&#39;t stop myself but be curious. She was always showing in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you? And what are you doing here?&#34; I glance around we are right in the middle of the woods next to the lake. The light coming from the moon was the only thing that is giving light to us. Reflection of the moon was shining in the middle of the lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that I could locked you up right now. Do you even know that you are trespassing in the Northern territory?&#34; Again no answer. It was like I was just talking to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you are not going to answer I will come close to you.&#34; I warned and again no one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman gave me no other choice. A glimmer of hope run in me as I walk slowly towards her. We are only a few feet away but my every steps feels like forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was finally standing next to her. I wasn&#39;t sure what to do anymore. All I could hear is my heart pounding loud, I was even afraid that she might hear how loud my heart is beating right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed her hand but as soon as I touch it, she was starting to shatter to pieces, like a broken glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is happening?&#34; Afraid that she might completely vanished I pulled her closer to me but as soon as I did that, she completely shattered like a broken glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there completely shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do?&#34; Someone&#39;s voice uttered, I look up to see everyone in the pack staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did they got here? They are all staring at me like I did a huge crime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you kill her?&#34; Someone said,  wait kill her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill her.&#34; I uttered in my defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean you did not kill her. You have her blood all over you.&#34; A little kid uttered, he has a blonde hair and a pair of green-blue eyes. He looks exactly like me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance down at my hands and my whole body froze. There she was completely covered with blood. Her cold body was laying in my arms as a sword was stab on her chest. And to my surprised I was holding the sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was me who stabbed her right in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widens as I realize what just happened. Her hair was covering her face, as I tried to reach for it with my trembling hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s voice woke me from my nightmare. She was staring at me with a worried look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne you are having a nightmare.&#34; She uttered her eyes was teary. I grabbed her and pulled her in my arms. For the first time I was genuinely feeling happy to see her beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I whispered, she hugged me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that I&#39;m always here for you.&#34; She whispered, a sudden guilt rose again. After everything I&#39;ve done to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away and lean close to kiss her. It was a gentle kiss and she kiss me back. Closing both our eyes our kissed deepens. I pulled her closer to me and her hands started to travel in my chest. I slowly move my way towards her neck. She moan as soon as my mouth touch her bare neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh... Dwayne.&#34; She pleaded as I reach for the hem of her night gown. I pulled it over her head showing her bare breast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blushed as I stared at her, she was beautiful, her white skin matching her red hair, I can see clearly some freckles on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reach to unbutton my pants and I let her. She was feeling hot at the moment. I let her do her thing, gasping for air as I grabbed her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled her towards me, she look disappointed because I didn&#39;t let her play with me longer. And I started kissing her then tearing off the only garment that she was wearing. She giggled at my action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it slowly Dwayne.&#34; She commented while rolling her eyes, I smiled a bit feeling guilty about why I&#39;m using her to released this unpleasant feeling that I had because of that dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again the memory of seeing that woman flash in my mind. Shaking my head I positioned myself between her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning I woke up because of the sun light hitting my eyes. I opened my eyes slowly, adjusting to the blinding light. I sat down and found Sarah sleeping soundly next to me. She was completely naked. Then the memories of what happened last night came to my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I did it again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance ones more at Sarah then went out to take a shower. When I got out she was still sleeping. I kissed her forehead before heading outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the first time Sarah and I done it again after I woke up. I wasn&#39;t even sure what on earth was I thinking that I did that again to her. Well she was saying we were a couple before I lost some of my memories but I couldn&#39;t shake off this feeling of being guilty over something thay I wasn&#39;t sure what is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone woke up late today.&#34; I turn around to see Alec, he was holding some training equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now that I notice half of the male of our pack are now in the training grounds. Most of them are around my age and some are just a few years older than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like they were serious about getting that Alpha challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you join us?&#34; Alec said, all of them stop doing their thing and stared at me. They all look at me, waiting for my response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could go and agree to them or just ignored them. But I don&#39;t like the smug look on Alec&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; I uttered, then entered the training grounds right at the open field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dale was standing not far from and when he finally saw me. He ran towards me. He was the only older werewolf who was here. He was probably here to monitor and make sure no one died before the real challenge happens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good to see you back.&#34; He uttered with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I answered shortly. He was probably used to my short answer and move to another topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well as you can see we will have a little sparring session.&#34; He uttered, I look around and see them having their partners already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But unlike the 1 on 1 fight, the winners will continue to fight the other challengers until they couldn&#39;t fight anymore. It was like the last man standing will be the winner.&#34; He explains, that explains the was they are all gathered into small circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the only was to make yourself a winner is if your opponent give up. But no one is allowed to shift to their wolf. Only one on one combat skills is allowed, weapons are completely prohibited. The one who tried to use one will receive a punishment&#34; He added making it loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel their burning gaze in my head as soon as Dale left. I&#39;m sure they all wanted to put bullets in my head. Especially after everything that happened which includes the last scouting in the dark forest which leads for everyone&#39;s death. They all blamed me for letting everyone die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everyone ready?&#34; Dale shouted, all of them said yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took off my shirt them move to the closest circle. I look at my opponent, he looks a few years older than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pick the wrong circle Alpha, oh right you aren&#39;t the Alpha anymore.&#34; He said, mocking me. I just ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even know who I am?&#34; He ask like he was someone important that I should remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I look like I even know your name? I don&#39;t really remember people who aren&#39;t worth remembering.&#34; I answered, which made his face red. He was really mad right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will make you remember.&#34; He said proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BEGIN!&#34; As soon as Dale said that he quickly launch at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was really hitting me hard and if I wasn&#39;t quick enough I would end up breaking a few bones. Graping his hand I used it to throw him over. I smack his head with my fist making him dizzy. I made sure not to use so much of my strength because I wouldn&#39;t just fight with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t let him recover, I pinned him down with my whole body weight while I pulled his left arm behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t give up now. I will break it.&#34; I warned as I pulled harder. He was stopping himself from screeching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will count to 3... 1 &#34; I stop then pulled harder than before. &#34;2&#34; I stop again making sure that he will feel his bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I give up!&#34; He shouted, I let go of him and he slowly stood up holding his left arm. He should be thankful that I didn&#39;t do it with his right arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I glance up, all of them was staring at us. The look of surprise was written all over their face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it that surprising? The only one who were smiling right now is Dale and Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally recover we all continue to battle one another. Just like what I did earlier I tried to finish it quickly. And I can say some of them actually knows how to fight. And there are the ones who trained in the South. Time flies fast, I received a few bruises from now and then. I can say that I was quite proud at how our warriors develop in just a short period of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their motives are still there but I can stop myself but feel amused on how they tried to keep up to my strength. I was still an Alpha by blood but they still tried to fight me head on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop towards my neck opponent and unlike the others that I fought with so far this one is actually looking dangerous. He was staring at me like I am some kind of a prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember the people who are with you that night?&#34; He suddenly blurted out, I look at him confusingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I answered, making him more mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you even call yourself an Alpha? You don&#39;t even remember their names.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything because he was right. They all died because I failed to protect them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just stood there and watch them die?&#34; I know whatever I say will only make him mad more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t fast enough to get there in time.&#34; I uttered, recalling the time where we are attacked by that creature. Just remembering how I was there and watch them be killed and can&#39;t do anything about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You aren&#39;t fast enough? Do you really want me to believe that?&#34; He scoff, why is he so mad at me? I scanned his face then an image pop in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He somehow look like Ryan who was killed and eaten by that creature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you are Ryan&#39;s brother?&#34; I mumbled, he didn&#39;t look surprised at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was the only family I had. And you let him get killed! So I will kill you myself.&#34; I glance at his hands, he took a small knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used my hand to blocked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will kill you!&#34;</p>
