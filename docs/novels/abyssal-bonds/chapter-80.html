                <p>Tharros frowned. &#34;Where&#39;s Maris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint shimmer in the water answered his question. Maris appeared from behind a fallen column, looking weaker but alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still here,&#34; she said, surprise in her voice. &#34;I thought you&#39;d flee after the collapse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We wouldn&#39;t leave without answers,&#34; Sophia replied. Through her Guardian senses, she could feel something different about the water around them. &#34;Something&#39;s changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maris nodded. &#34;The Division is weakening. Without the Leviathan to maintain it or destroy it, it&#39;s becoming unstable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly is the Division?&#34; Tharros asked, his voice rumbling with authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Maris pointed to the shattered platform where they had stood during their bonding. The keystones were still there, glowing faintly despite being buried under rubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those aren&#39;t just decorations,&#34; she explained. &#34;They&#39;re the control points for the Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their bond still fresh and strong, the four mates worked together to clear the debris. Their different powers made the job easy - Tharros&#39;s strength, Kael&#39;s precision, Arin&#39;s magic, and Sophia&#39;s Guardian light guiding them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the keystones were uncovered, Sophia gasped. They were arranged in a pattern she recognized from her research - the same pattern as the ocean currents that surrounded Lumaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand now,&#34; she said, kneeling to touch one of the stones. It pulsed under her fingers like a heartbeat. &#34;The Division isn&#39;t a wall between worlds. It&#39;s a circulation system - like blood flowing through a body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maris looked surprised. &#34;How did you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I can feel it,&#34; Sophia answered. Through her Guardian senses, she could see energy flowing between the keystones, weak but still moving. &#34;It was never meant to separate worlds. It was meant to create balance between them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros crouched beside her. &#34;Then why did you try to destroy it, Maris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ancient Guardian lowered her eyes. &#34;I misunderstood its purpose. I thought it was keeping worlds apart when it was actually keeping them connected in the right way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Leviathan,&#34; Arin said suddenly. &#34;It wasn&#39;t evil, was it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Maris admitted. &#34;It was the Division&#39;s protector before I corrupted it with my anger and fear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they spoke, Sophia noticed the keystones growing brighter. Through their bond, she could feel her mates noticing it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re responding to us,&#34; Kael said. &#34;To our bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood, understanding flowing through her like the currents around them. &#34;The four of us together - we represent the balance the Division needs. Land and sea, magic and science, past and future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; Arin asked, her green magic swirling around her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t repair the Division,&#34; Sophia said with certainty. &#34;We heal it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting on instinct, she placed her hand on the central keystone. It blazed with white light, and she felt a pull through their bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Join me,&#34; she called to her mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t hesitate. Tharros placed his large hand over hers, his gold dragon magic merging with her white Guardian light. Kael added his touch, silver warrior power strengthening the connection. Arin completed the circle, her emerald sea witch energy flowing into the mix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they all connected, a shock wave of energy burst from the keystones. The water around them began to glow with the same beautiful aurora they had seen when the Leviathan transformed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s working,&#34; Maris whispered, watching in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through their bond, Sophia could feel something else - a presence in the water, curious and ancient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hello, she thought toward it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You see me, came the reply, not in words but in feelings and images. After so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Leviathan,&#34; Sophia said aloud for the others. &#34;Not the monster it became, but what it was meant to be - a guardian of balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, she saw images of what the Division truly was - a complex system of magical currents that allowed energy to flow between worlds while keeping them distinct. The Leviathan had been its caretaker, not its destroyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was never meant to be controlled or used,&#34; she explained to the others. &#34;Just balanced and protected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maris stepped forward, hesitation in every movement. &#34;Let me help,&#34; she said. &#34;Let me make amends for what I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, and Maris added her hand to theirs on the keystone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ancient Guardian&#39;s knowledge flowed through their connection - centuries of wisdom about how the Division worked. With her guidance, they directed the combined magic of their bond through the keystones in the correct pattern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water around them began to pulse with color and light. The broken pieces of the temple lifted from the ocean floor, not reassembling but transforming into something new - a garden of crystal and coral that followed the same patterns as the Division itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beautiful,&#34; Arin breathed, watching the transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through their bond, all four mates could feel the Leviathan&#39;s essence spreading through the Division, taking its rightful place as guardian once more. But it was different now - touched by their bond, infused with their combined magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Division is healing,&#34; Maris said, wonder in her voice. &#34;You&#39;ve done what the original Guardians couldn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the magic stabilized, they felt a deep rumble through the water. Not from the temple this time, but from the ocean floor itself. The sand shifted, revealing glowing lines that spread outward in all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening now?&#34; Kael asked, his warrior senses on alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maris&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Lumaria is awakening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lines of light grew brighter, connecting to form complex patterns across the ocean floor. Ancient structures began to rise from beneath the sand - not buildings, but living systems made of crystal and coral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s Lumaria?&#34; Tharros asked, his dragon eyes tracking the changes with fascination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not what,&#34; Maris corrected. &#34;Who. Lumaria is the first Guardian - the one who created the Division. Her consciousness has been sleeping beneath the ocean for millennia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, the patterns of light began to pulse in rhythm, like a massive heartbeat. Sophia could feel it resonating with their bond, with the Division, with the transformed Leviathan - all parts of a greater whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s awakening because she feels the Division healing,&#34; Sophia realized. &#34;She feels us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice surrounded them, not in words but in feelings that they all understood differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last. Balance returns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice felt ancient and wise, but also alive and curious. It touched each of them differently - Tharros felt recognition of his leadership, Kael sensed respect for his courage, Arin experienced acceptance of her magic, and Sophia received understanding of her bridge between worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they could respond, the light patterns suddenly flickered. The voice faded, and the structures that had been rising sank partially back into the sand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s wrong,&#34; Maris said, alarm in her voice. &#34;Lumaria is struggling to awaken fully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The keystones dimmed, their energy draining away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Arin asked, trying to feed more of her magic into their connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maris&#39;s face paled. &#34;The Division is healed in this location, but there are other nodes around the world. Without them all active, Lumaria can&#39;t fully awaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground shook beneath them again as Lumaria&#39;s systems fought to stabilize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s trying to tell us something,&#34; Sophia said, focusing on the fading voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Images flashed through their bond - other temples, other keystones, scattered across the world&#39;s oceans. Seven in total, each guarding a critical node of the Division.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to find the other temples,&#34; Sophia told her mates. &#34;This is just the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the light faded from the ocean floor, leaving only the central pattern around them glowing, they felt Lumaria&#39;s presence retreat into slumber once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s waiting,&#34; Maris said. &#34;For all the temples to be healed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their bond hummed with new purpose as they looked at each other. The journey ahead would be long and dangerous, but they would face it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do we start?&#34; Kael asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could answer, a pulse of energy rippled through the water. In the distance, a new light began to glow - a beacon calling them forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think,&#34; Sophia said with a smile, &#34;we just got our answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heroes of the Deep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journey back to Aquaria took three days. Sophia, her three mates, and Maris swam through waters that seemed brighter somehow, as if the ocean itself was celebrating their victory. They carried the rebalanced keystones in a net of magic woven by Arin and Maris together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look!&#34; Kael pointed ahead where the first glowing spires of Aquaria rose from the sea floor. &#34;We&#39;re almost home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Home. The word felt right to Sophia now. Just weeks ago, she&#39;d been a scientist on a research vessel, unaware of her true nature or the underwater world that would claim her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached the city gates, Sophia noticed something unusual. Crowds had gathered along the coral walls, their faces expectant. Word of their battle with the Leviathan had somehow reached Aquaria before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re waiting for us,&#34; Tharros said, surprise in his voice. The dragon king was used to respect, but the faces in the crowd showed something more - hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin swam closer to Sophia. &#34;Are you ready for this? You&#39;re about to become a legend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could answer, trumpets made of giant seashells sounded from the towers. The gates swung open, and a procession of mer-guards in silver armor swam out to meet them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King Tharros,&#34; the lead guard said, bowing deeply. &#34;The Council awaits you and your mates in the Great Hall. News of your victory has brought joy to all of Aquaria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maris hung back, uncertain. &#34;Perhaps I should not-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re coming with us,&#34; Sophia said firmly, taking the ancient Guardian&#39;s hand. &#34;Redemption starts now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The five of them swam through Aquaria&#39;s streets, followed by cheering crowds. Children darted around them, their small tails flashing in colorful streaks. Some brave ones touched the glowing keystones, giggling when the stones pulsed with light in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Great Hall of Aquaria was packed with representatives from every underwater species - mer-people with tails of every color, shark-folk with their intimidating teeth, gentle whale singers, and even a delegation of surface dwellers in special breathing suits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros took his place on the royal dais, but instead of sitting alone on his throne, he gestured for Sophia, Kael, and Arin to join him. Four thrones now stood where once there had been one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People of Aquaria,&#34; Tharros&#39;s voice boomed across the hall. &#34;We return with news of victory. The Leviathan is no more - or rather, it has been restored to its true purpose as guardian of the Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers swept through the crowd at this revelation. Sophia stepped forward, her Guardian light glowing softly around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Division was never meant to separate our worlds,&#34; she explained. &#34;It was created to maintain balance between them. For too long, we&#39;ve misunderstood its purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured to the keystones floating beside them. &#34;These will be the foundation of a new system - a Guardian Council that will protect and maintain the balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An elder from the Shark Clan pushed forward. &#34;And who will lead this council? You, surface dweller?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could respond, Kael stepped beside her. The silver markings of his royal heritage now shone clearly on his skin for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Prince Kael Stormwind of the Eastern Seas,&#34; he announced, his voice strong and clear. &#34;For years I hid my identity, believing leadership was a burden. Now I see it as an opportunity to forge new connections between all species of the sea - and the land.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs of surprise rippled through the crowd. Many had suspected Kael&#39;s mysterious past, but few had guessed his royal blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Council will include representatives from all realms,&#34; Sophia continued. &#34;Land and sea alike.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin moved forward next, her sea witch magic swirling around her in emerald patterns. &#34;My tower, once closed to all but me, will now be a place of learning. Those who wish to understand the balance between light and dark magic will be welcome there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd&#39;s reaction was mixed - sea witches had long been viewed with suspicion. But Arin stood tall, her connection to her mates giving her confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Maris stepped forward, facing the crowd that had once revered her as a legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I created the Leviathan from fear and misunderstanding,&#34; she admitted. &#34;Now I offer my knowledge to help rebuild what was broken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros rejoined his mates at the center of the dais. He took Sophia&#39;s hand, then Kael&#39;s, then Arin&#39;s, forming a circle of their bond for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The prophecy spoke of hearts united,&#34; he said. &#34;Not just our four, but all hearts who seek balance and peace. This is the true meaning of our bond - not power for ourselves, but harmony for all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted in cheers that shook the coral pillars of the Great Hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, as celebrations continued throughout Aquaria, the four mates slipped away to the sacred pools in the palace&#39;s inner sanctuary. The water there glowed with magic older than Aquaria itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never seen the pools so bright,&#34; Tharros said as they approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia knelt by the largest pool, touching her fingers to its surface. The water rippled, then formed images - visions of Aquaria flourishing, of new cities rising from the sea floor, of surface dwellers and sea folk working together to heal the oceans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The future looks promising,&#34; Kael said, his arm around Arin&#39;s waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But first,&#34; Arin reminded them with a smile, &#34;we have a ceremony to complete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though their bond had been forged in battle, the formal binding ceremony had been interrupted by the Leviathan&#39;s attack. Now, with peace restored, preparations could properly begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three days from now,&#34; Tharros declared, &#34;when the ocean currents align with the stars above. We&#39;ll complete what we started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia smiled at her three mates, feeling their love through their bond. &#34;I can&#39;t wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they turned to leave the sacred pools, a final image appeared in the water - six points of light scattered across a map of Earth&#39;s oceans, pulsing in rhythm with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The other temples,&#34; Sophia whispered. &#34;They&#39;re calling to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maris appeared in the doorway, her face solemn. &#34;Lumaria stirs beneath the waves. The Division has begun to heal, but our work is far from done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After the ceremony,&#34; Kael said firmly. &#34;Some things can&#39;t wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked together from the sanctuary, minds filled with thoughts of both celebration and challenges ahead. Their bond had saved Aquaria, but greater tasks awaited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As night fell over the underwater kingdom, lights glowed from every tower and home. Music drifted through the currents, and laughter echoed along the coral streets. For tonight, at least, all was well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her chamber that night, Sophia stood by the window overlooking the city, watching the celebrations below. A soft knock at her door revealed Tharros, Kael, and Arin, all smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We couldn&#39;t sleep,&#34; Tharros admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too excited about the ceremony?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael shook his head. &#34;Too worried about what comes after. The other temples won&#39;t be as easy as the first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin touched the mark on her wrist - the symbol of their bond that had appeared during their battle with the Leviathan. &#34;Whatever comes, we face it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they embraced, a tremor ran through the palace, subtle but unmistakable. The four mates exchanged worried glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you feel that?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded grimly. &#34;Lumaria grows impatient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the celebrations continued, unaware of the slight shake. But in the sacred pools, new images formed in the water - darkness gathering around the distant temples, forces already moving to stop what the four mates had started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their victory had begun a new chapter, but the story was far from over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dawn of Two Worlds</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Six months had passed since the battle with the Leviathan. Sophia stood on the balcony of her new laboratory in the highest tower of the coral palace, watching surface ships pass overhead. These weren&#39;t ordinary research vessels - they were part of the Aquarian-Human Alliance, the first official diplomatic connection between land and sea in thousands of years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Admiring your handiwork?&#34; Kael&#39;s voice came from behind her as he wrapped his arms around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia smiled, leaning back against him. &#34;It still doesn&#39;t feel real sometimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Below them, Aquaria sparkled with renewed life. The city had grown since their victory, with new coral structures rising alongside ancient buildings. Surface technology blended seamlessly with ocean magic - waterproof tablets displaying ancient texts, magical currents powering human machinery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The delegation from the Pacific kingdoms arrives tomorrow,&#34; Kael said. &#34;They&#39;re eager to meet the famous four who united the worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia laughed. &#34;Famous four? Is that what they&#39;re calling us now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better than &#39;the prophecy people,&#39;&#34; Tharros said, joining them on the balcony. The dragon king wore ceremonial armor that caught the ocean light. His eyes, once cold and distant, now sparkled with warmth when he looked at his mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you nervous about tomorrow?&#34; Sophia asked, taking his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A dragon king is never nervous,&#34; Tharros replied with mock seriousness before his face softened. &#34;But yes. This binding ceremony means more than our first attempt. The whole ocean will be watching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And part of the land,&#34; Arin added, appearing in a swirl of emerald magic. &#34;Your human friends arrive tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart jumped with excitement. Dr. Chen and the research team from Genesis would be the first humans officially invited to witness an underwater royal ceremony. Her two worlds, finally meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything ready at the gateway?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded. &#34;Your old research facility has been fully converted. The magical barrier allows controlled passage now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had once been a place of captivity for Tharros was now a bridge between worlds. Sophia had spent months teaching her human colleagues and Aquarian scholars to work together, translating science into magic and back again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should rest,&#34; Kael suggested. &#34;Tomorrow will be a long day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as they turned to go inside, a messenger approached, swimming rapidly through the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesties,&#34; the young mer-girl said, bowing hurriedly. &#34;There&#39;s a situation at the Western Gateway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros frowned. &#34;What kind of situation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A human vessel. Not one of ours. They&#39;ve dropped some kind of device into the Division barrier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia exchanged worried glances with her mates. Not everyone on land had embraced the new alliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Western Gateway was a shimmering wall of magic that separated Aquarian waters from the open ocean. Sophia and her mates arrived to find palace guards surrounding a metal sphere that pulsed with red light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch it,&#34; Sophia warned, swimming closer. &#34;It looks like a sonar device, but modified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin waved her hands over the object, green magic flowing around it. &#34;It&#39;s trying to map the Division barriers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s looking for weaknesses,&#34; Kael said grimly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros growled, air bubbles escaping his mouth. &#34;Always humans who-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not all humans,&#34; Sophia interrupted gently. &#34;Just like not all mer-people welcomed me at first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin placed her hands on the device. &#34;I can disable it, but we should learn who sent it first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her magic flowed into the sphere, images appeared above it - a projection of a sleek black ship with no markings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oceanic Research Institute,&#34; Sophia whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your former employers?&#34; Kael asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her stomach tightening. &#34;But I never knew who really funded them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image shifted to show a man in an expensive suit, his face hidden in shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to secure all gateways,&#34; Tharros ordered the guards. &#34;Double the patrols.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the ceremony tomorrow-&#34; one guard began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will proceed as planned,&#34; Sophia said firmly. &#34;We won&#39;t let fear drive us apart again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael touched the mark on his wrist - the symbol of their bond. &#34;We&#39;ve faced worse than corporate spies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin finished her spell, and the device went dark. &#34;I&#39;ve sent a little surprise back to their sensors. They&#39;ll be seeing nothing but kelp fields for weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia smiled despite her worry. &#34;Let&#39;s return to the palace. We have a ceremony to prepare for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Great Coral Cathedral was filled with light and music on the day of the binding ceremony. Representatives from all underwater kingdoms floated in the upper galleries. Human dignitaries, including Dr. Chen, watched in wonder from a special air-filled chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia wore a gown of living coral and pearls that moved with her as she swam to the center of the cathedral. Her three mates waited for her there, each dressed in ceremonial attire representing their heritage - Tharros in dragon-scale armor, Kael in royal mer-warrior regalia, and Arin in the flowing robes of a sea witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The High Priestess of Aquaria, a ancient mer-woman with silver hair that floated like a cloud around her, conducted the ceremony in both mer-language and English.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today we witness the fulfillment of the ancient prophecy,&#34; she announced. &#34;Four hearts united not just by fate, but by choice.&#34;</p>
