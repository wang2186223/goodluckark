                <p>&#34;It&#39;s working!&#34; Arin exclaimed, watching as the corruption retreated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But their victory was short-lived. From the shrinking portal came a final, desperate attack. Not tendrils this time, but a wave of pure dark energy that spread outward like an underwater explosion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brace yourselves!&#34; Kael shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four of them huddled together as the wave hit them. Instead of pain, Sophia felt a strange connection forming between them-stronger than anything they&#39;d experienced before. Their bodies began to glow, each with their unique signature: Tharros&#39;s fiery gold, Kael&#39;s steady silver, Arin&#39;s mysterious green, and Sophia&#39;s bright blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The colors swirled together, creating a protective sphere around them. Where the dark energy touched their combined light, it transformed, becoming pure and clear again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Sophia asked, her voice echoing strangely through the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The prophecy,&#34; Arin whispered. &#34;Our bond is completing itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through their connected minds, Sophia suddenly understood. The barrier between worlds had been artificially strengthened thousands of years ago, cutting off the natural flow of magic between surface and sea. The purification nodes weren&#39;t just fighting corruption-they were restoring balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the portal finally closed with a flash of light, a new sensation spread through the ocean. Everywhere, the natural magic of the sea began to reach toward the surface, while the forgotten magic of the land reached downward. Where they met, they strengthened each other, creating a bridge between worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Aquaria, bioluminescent cities shone brighter than they had in centuries. On land, plants near coastlines burst into unprecedented growth. Animals long thought mythical began to stir from hidden places, awakening to a world newly infused with ancient magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four partners floated in the deep trench, their glowing bodies still connected by threads of light. Through their bond, Sophia could feel what was happening around the world-the restoration of something precious that had been broken long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did it,&#34; she said, wonder filling her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Tharros corrected gently. &#34;We&#39;ve only begun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael pointed upward, where strange lights now danced across the ocean. &#34;The barrier isn&#39;t gone-it&#39;s transformed. Now it will filter, not block.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the Voidcallers,&#34; Sophia began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were never our true enemy,&#34; Arin finished. &#34;Just symptoms of the imbalance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they began their slow ascent from the trench, Sophia felt the changes in her body solidifying. The transformation that had begun when she first met Tharros was completing itself. Not turning her fully mer, or witch, or dragon, but something new-a bridge between all worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, celebrations had begun as reports came in of the corruption retreating worldwide. The President prepared to address a waiting nation. Dr. Chen analyzed the readings from their sensors, his face alight with scientific wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But deep in the Mariana Trench, something stirred in the space where the portal had been. A tiny crack, no bigger than a fingernail, remained in the fabric of reality. Through it seeped not purple corruption, but something else entirely-something ancient and patient, drawn by the sudden surge of magic in a world long denied to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sophia and her partners rose toward the waiting ships, they remained unaware of what watched them from that tiny crack-something that had been waiting thousands of years for the barriers to weaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that whispered a single word into the dark waters:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>New Beginnings</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tiny crack at the bottom of the ocean pulsed with strange light. One week had passed since they closed the portal, yet Sophia couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something watched them. Standing on the deck of the Genesis research vessel, she gazed at the horizon where ocean met sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penny for your thoughts?&#34; Kael&#39;s voice startled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned to find him looking almost human in jeans and a t-shirt. His silver eyes were hidden behind sunglasses, but nothing could disguise the graceful way he moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wondering what&#39;s next,&#34; she admitted. &#34;I never thought I&#39;d see you up here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael smiled, joining her at the railing. &#34;The new connection between worlds makes it possible. Arin&#39;s magic helps too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if summoned by her name, Arin appeared from below deck. Her green hair fluttered in the breeze, drawing curious glances from the crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tharros is coming,&#34; she announced. &#34;He&#39;s bringing news from Aquaria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart quickened. Since their battle at the trench, Tharros had been busy rebuilding the underwater kingdom&#39;s defenses. This would be their first reunion as a complete group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water near the ship bubbled and churned. Scientists rushed to the railing, cameras ready. With a splash that sent water spraying across the deck, Tharros emerged in human form, leaping onto the ship with inhuman grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show-off,&#34; Kael muttered, but his eyes sparkled with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros shook water from his golden hair. His eyes found Sophia immediately, and the bond between them hummed with energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re late,&#34; she said, fighting a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kings are never late,&#34; he replied, pulling her into a fierce hug that lifted her feet off the deck. &#34;Everyone else is simply early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Chen approached, clipboard in hand. &#34;If you&#39;re done with the reunion, we have work to do. The readings from the trench are... concerning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the ship&#39;s laboratory, holographic displays showed the ocean floor. The crack that had appeared after the portal closed had grown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s spreading,&#34; Dr. Chen explained. &#34;And releasing some kind of energy we can&#39;t identify.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin placed her hand over one of the displays. Green light flowed from her fingers, enhancing the image. &#34;It&#39;s not Void energy. It&#39;s older. Ancient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we close it like we did the portal?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros shook his head. &#34;The purification nodes won&#39;t work. This isn&#39;t corruption-it&#39;s transformation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34; Kael demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means our worlds are changing,&#34; Arin said softly. &#34;The balance we restored is creating something new.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt a tingle along her neck where her gills had formed during the battle. &#34;We need to see it up close. All of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Chen frowned. &#34;Another diving mission? After what happened last time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not diving,&#34; Sophia said. &#34;Something better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, they stood in a circle on the rear deck. The crew had been ordered to stay inside, giving them privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about this?&#34; Kael asked, squeezing Sophia&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she admitted. &#34;But I can feel the change inside me. I think we all can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true. Since the battle, their bond had grown stronger. Sophia could sense the others&#39; emotions, sometimes even their thoughts. The partial transformation that had saved her life continued to evolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Together, then,&#34; Tharros said, completing their circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They joined hands. Immediately, their unique energies began to flow between them-Tharros&#39;s fiery gold, Kael&#39;s steady silver, Arin&#39;s mysterious green, and Sophia&#39;s bright blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Focus on the crack,&#34; Arin instructed. &#34;See through the water, through the darkness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes. In her mind, she dove deep, racing past coral reefs and schools of fish, down into the midnight zone where no light penetrated. Except now, she wasn&#39;t alone. She could feel the others with her, their combined consciousness moving as one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached the crack, Sophia gasped. It wasn&#39;t just a tear in reality-it was a doorway. Through it, she glimpsed another world, one filled with swirling colors and impossible shapes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that place?&#34; she whispered, her voice echoing strangely in their shared vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The realm between realms,&#34; Tharros answered. &#34;Where magic was born.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they watched, tendrils of energy-not purple corruption, but rainbow light-reached through the crack toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s calling to us,&#34; Kael realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Arin corrected. &#34;It&#39;s calling to what we&#39;ve become. Together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tendrils touched their merged consciousness. Instead of pain, Sophia felt a rush of knowledge. Images flooded her mind-ancient Aquaria before the barriers, humans and mer swimming side by side, dragons soaring over both land and sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is how it was,&#34; Tharros breathed. &#34;Before the separation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how it could be again,&#34; added a new voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t alone in the vision. A figure materialized before them, neither human nor Aquarian, but something else entirely. Its body seemed made of living water and light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am what remains of the First Balance,&#34; the figure replied. &#34;Long ago, your ancestors feared the mixing of worlds and magic. They created barriers that were never meant to exist. Your actions have begun to heal this ancient wound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The crack-you&#39;re coming through it,&#34; Kael said, his tone wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not just me. The true nature of your world wants to return.&#34; The figure gestured to the rainbow tendrils. &#34;But the healing has only begun. The forces that fear change are already moving against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if summoned by these words, darkness began to seep around the edges of the crack. Not the purple corruption they had fought before, but something slick and oily that seemed to repel the rainbow light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s adapting,&#34; Arin realized. &#34;Learning from our last encounter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The nodes won&#39;t work again,&#34; the figure confirmed. &#34;This enemy evolves. It feeds on separation and fear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what do we do?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure&#39;s gaze fell on her. &#34;Your group represents what was lost-dragon, mer, witch, and human, working as one. But to truly heal the world, the barriers must fall completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want us to merge the surface and underwater worlds?&#34; Tharros looked shocked. &#34;That would change everything. Millions of lives would be affected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Millions of lives are already at risk,&#34; the figure countered. &#34;The corruption grows stronger each day. Your temporary measures buy time, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darkness around the crack pulsed, growing thicker. Tendrils of rainbow light fought against it, but they were being pushed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go,&#34; Arin warned. &#34;Our physical bodies can&#39;t maintain this connection much longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their shared vision began to fade, the figure reached toward them one last time. &#34;Find the seven ancient keystones. They were created as a failsafe, should the barriers ever need to fall. United, they can complete what you&#39;ve begun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are they?&#34; Kael asked urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scattered. Hidden. Three in Aquaria, three on land, and one in the place between.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision shattered. Sophia gasped as her consciousness slammed back into her body. She stumbled, nearly falling to the deck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strong arms caught her-Tharros. His face was pale, his eyes troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did everyone see that?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nods all around. Even Dr. Chen, who had been watching from the laboratory window, rushed out to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your bodies were glowing,&#34; he said excitedly. &#34;We recorded the most amazing energy readings!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sophia barely heard him. Her mind raced with the implications of what they&#39;d learned. &#34;We need to find those keystones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And quickly,&#34; Arin added, her face grim. &#34;That darkness was already stronger than the corruption we fought before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s expression hardened into determination. &#34;We&#39;ll need to split up. We can cover more ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sent a chill through Sophia. Their strength had always been in unity. Separation seemed dangerous, especially now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros must have sensed her fear. He took her hand, his touch warm and reassuring. &#34;Even apart, our bond remains. We&#39;ll stay connected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three in Aquaria, three on land,&#34; Sophia repeated. &#34;Tharros and Kael should search underwater. Arin and I will take the surface.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the seventh?&#34; Arin asked. &#34;The one in &#39;the place between&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked out at the ocean, where somewhere far below, a crack in reality was slowly widening. &#34;We&#39;ll find that one together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they began planning their search, Sophia couldn&#39;t shake a growing sense of dread. The figure had said the keystones were created as a failsafe. But what exactly would happen when all seven were united? Would merging their worlds truly save them-or create something even more dangerous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And somewhere in the deepest trench, watching through that tiny crack, something ancient and patient continued to whisper:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Echoes of Lost Atlantis</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ancient scroll crackled under Tharros&#39;s fingers as he carefully unrolled it across the stone table. Dust particles danced in the beam of blue light emanating from the crystal lamps mounted on the archive walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure this is the right one?&#34; Kael asked, leaning over the dragon king&#39;s shoulder. His silver eyes narrowed as he studied the faded markings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is it,&#34; Tharros confirmed. His voice echoed through the vast chamber of the Royal Archives, a hidden section beneath the palace that few even knew existed. &#34;The map Sophia decoded points directly here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three weeks had passed since they&#39;d closed the portal in the Mariana Trench. Three weeks of celebrations, recovery, and planning. But while the immediate threat had been contained, Sophia&#39;s discovery in the ancient texts suggested something more troubling was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The keystones,&#34; Kael murmured, tracing the spiral pattern on the scroll with his finger. &#34;Four artifacts from before the separation of worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, his golden eyes reflecting the crystal light. &#34;The scroll says the first one is hidden here, protected by magic most have forgotten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The archives stretched around them, endless shelves filled with the collected knowledge of Aquarian civilization. Waterproof scrolls, crystal tablets, and memory pearls containing the thoughts of long-dead scholars lined the walls in neat rows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There,&#34; Kael pointed to a symbol on the scroll that matched a marking carved into the floor nearby. &#34;The entrance should be beneath that tile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they moved to the spot. The tile looked like any other-smooth blue stone etched with the royal crest of Aquaria. Tharros pressed his palm against it, sending a pulse of magic through the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps it requires both of us,&#34; Kael suggested. &#34;The prophecy speaks of combined power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They placed their hands side by side on the cold stone. Immediately, Tharros felt the familiar warmth spread through his arm-the same sensation he experienced whenever their magic connected. Kael&#39;s silver energy mixed with his golden power, creating a swirling pattern that sank into the tile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a low rumble, the floor shifted. The tile sank downward, then slid aside, revealing a narrow passage glowing with strange blue light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After you, Your Majesty,&#34; Kael said with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros snorted. &#34;Always so formal, even when we&#39;re about to risk our lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Old habits,&#34; Kael replied as they descended into the passage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tunnel sloped steeply downward, leading them deeper beneath the palace than Tharros had ever ventured. The walls were lined with an unknown material that seemed to pulse with its own inner light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This architecture doesn&#39;t match anything in Aquaria,&#34; Tharros observed, running his hand along the smooth surface. &#34;It feels... older.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much older,&#34; Kael agreed. &#34;Like something from before the Great Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tunnel suddenly opened into a circular chamber. In the center stood a pedestal carved from a single piece of luminescent crystal. Atop it sat a small object-a six-sided crystal the size of Tharros&#39;s palm, pulsing with blue-green light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The First Keystone,&#34; Tharros breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached, the crystal pulsed more rapidly, as if recognizing their presence. Runes were carved into each face, similar to the ones that had appeared on Sophia&#39;s skin during her transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we wait for the others?&#34; Kael asked, hesitating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros shook his head. &#34;The text was clear-retrieving each keystone requires different combinations of our abilities. This one needs dragon and mer magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the crystal, but Kael caught his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; the mer warrior warned. &#34;Look at the floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounding the pedestal was a ring of symbols-ancient warnings etched into the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s protected,&#34; Kael translated. &#34;We&#39;ll need to disarm the trap first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros examined the symbols more carefully. &#34;Not disarm... satisfy. It wants proof we&#39;re the rightful retrievers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding dawned in Kael&#39;s eyes. &#34;Our marks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men removed their shirts, revealing the magical symbols that had appeared on their skin after bonding with Sophia. Tharros&#39;s dragon mark spread across his chest like a living tattoo, while Kael&#39;s triton symbol curved along his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they stepped closer to the pedestal, their marks began to glow. The ring of symbols on the floor responded, lighting up in sequence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now,&#34; Tharros said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together they reached for the keystone. The moment their fingers touched the crystal, a blinding flash of light filled the chamber. Tharros felt a jolt of energy surge through his body, and suddenly, his mind was filled with visions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vast underwater city, far larger and more advanced than modern Aquaria. Spires of crystal and gold reaching toward the surface. People with features of both human and sea creatures moving freely through water and air. Machines powered by magic. Harmony between all realms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then darkness. A great conflict. The decision to separate. The keystones being hidden away as a final safeguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice echoing across time: &#34;When the four reunite, the barrier between worlds will be restored to its proper form.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision faded, leaving Tharros gasping. Beside him, Kael&#39;s eyes were wide with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see-&#34; Kael began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Tharros answered. &#34;The world before the Division. They weren&#39;t just stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The keystone now rested in Tharros&#39;s palm, its light dimmed to a gentle glow. But as they turned to leave, a deep rumbling shook the chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we triggered something,&#34; Kael warned, drawing his blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smooth walls of the chamber began to shift. From them emerged figures-guardians shaped from living coral and crystal, their forms vaguely humanoid with weapons grown from their limbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run!&#34; Tharros shouted, clutching the keystone tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sprinted back toward the tunnel, the guardians in close pursuit. Shards of crystal flew past Tharros&#39;s head as the creatures attacked. One caught him across the shoulder, drawing blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael spun, slashing at the nearest guardian with his blade. The creature shattered, only to reform moments later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can&#39;t be killed!&#34; Kael called. &#34;They&#39;re part of the security system!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the tunnel, but more guardians were emerging from the walls ahead, blocking their escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Other way!&#34; Tharros decided, pulling Kael down a side passage that had appeared during the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This new tunnel twisted and turned, sloping ever deeper. The guardians followed relentlessly, their crystalline bodies making an eerie scraping sound against the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where does this lead?&#34; Kael gasped as they ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea,&#34; Tharros admitted. &#34;The archives didn&#39;t mention this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tunnel abruptly ended at a solid wall. Trapped, they turned to face the approaching guardians.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Together,&#34; Tharros said, raising his free hand. Kael nodded, raising his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their combined magic struck the guardians, slowing them but not stopping their advance. The keystone in Tharros&#39;s hand suddenly pulsed brighter, as if responding to their desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting on instinct, Tharros pressed the keystone against the wall behind them. The stone surface rippled like water, and suddenly they were falling backward through what had seemed solid moments before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They landed hard on a smooth floor, the wall solidifying behind them, cutting off the guardians&#39; pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael recovered first, helping Tharros to his feet. &#34;Where are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood in a vast cavern, far larger than the chamber they&#39;d left. And spread before them was something impossible-an ancient cityscape preserved beneath the ocean floor. Buildings of unfamiliar design stretched into the distance, illuminated by the same strange light they&#39;d seen in the tunnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think,&#34; Tharros said slowly, &#34;we just found Atlantis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his palm, the keystone pulsed with renewed purpose. And deep within the silent city, something ancient stirred, awakening after thousands of years of slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tharros,&#34; Kael whispered, pointing to a distant tower where a light had begun to glow. &#34;We&#39;re not alone down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dragon king tightened his grip on the keystone. &#34;Let&#39;s find out who our new neighbors are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, the wall that had seemed so solid began to ripple once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Collector&#39;s Prize</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain poured down the windows of the sleek black car as it wound along the coastal road. Sophia peered through the glass at the angry ocean below. The waves crashed against the cliffs with unusual force, spraying foam high into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The sea feels wrong,&#34; Arin said quietly from the driver&#39;s seat. Her green eyes flicked between the road and the churning water. &#34;It&#39;s been getting worse since we closed the portal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, feeling the wrongness in her bones. Three weeks had passed since their battle in the Mariana Trench, and while they&#39;d stopped the immediate threat, something else was brewing. The tiny crack they&#39;d left behind was growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any word from Tharros and Kael?&#34; she asked, checking her phone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing since they entered the archives,&#34; Arin replied. &#34;The palace shields block most signals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia tried not to worry. Their bond would have alerted her if either man was in real danger. Still, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of urgency that had driven them to split up in their search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car rounded a bend, revealing a massive estate perched on the edge of the cliff. Stone walls surrounded the property, topped with security cameras that tracked their approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it,&#34; Sophia said. &#34;Morrow Manor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The iron gates opened automatically as they approached. Arin drove slowly up the curved driveway, parking in front of a sprawling mansion built of gray stone and glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember the plan,&#34; Sophia said as they stepped out into the rain. &#34;We&#39;re researchers from the Oceanic Institute, interested in historical accounts of unusual ocean phenomena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin adjusted her disguise-a professional pantsuit that hid her natural sea witch markings. &#34;And if he doesn&#39;t buy it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we move to plan B,&#34; Sophia said, patting her bag where several vials of Arin&#39;s memory-altering potion were safely tucked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A butler greeted them at the door, ushering them into a grand entrance hall. The walls were lined with display cases containing maritime artifacts-ancient navigation tools, pieces of shipwrecks, and maps yellowed with age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Rodriguez and Ms. Blacktide,&#34; announced the butler, &#34;to see Mr. Morrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows of a connecting room emerged a tall, thin man with silver hair and piercing blue eyes. He wore an expensive suit and a calculating smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to my humble collection,&#34; said Jefferson Morrow, extending his hand. &#34;Though I must say, the Oceanic Institute doesn&#39;t usually send such... interesting representatives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt a chill. Something in his eyes suggested he knew more than he was letting on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We specialize in historical anomalies,&#34; she replied smoothly. &#34;Your collection is quite famous in certain circles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it now?&#34; Morrow&#39;s smile didn&#39;t reach his eyes. &#34;Well then, allow me to show you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led them through room after room filled with maritime treasures. Ancient pottery recovered from shipwrecks. Ceremonial items from coastal civilizations. Charts showing mysterious ocean currents.</p>
