                <p>The preparations for the upcoming Lunathion ritual had brought Goldie and Remy even closer. Despite the large condition that was attached to the ritual, Goldie wanted to stick to her promise. It wasn&#39;t that the thought of consummating the ritual with Remy was a disgusting thought... she just found it weird and awkward since they were not close in the romantic sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy had assured her she could back down at any moment if she wasn&#39;t comfortable with it and she was keeping her options open for the meantime. As the ritual neared, everyone in the house was assigned one task or the other. She was given cleanup duty and told to clean up the rooms in the annexes. Remy had joined her shortly after they had given her her task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they worked side by side, moving furniture and setting up beds for the pack members who would be arriving for the ceremony, Goldie couldn&#39;t help but steal glances at Remy. He was a good looking man and she couldn&#39;t help but look at him, with his long dark hair that she kept having the insane urge to run her hands through and his warm golden eyes that reminded her of golden honey, and his easygoing personality made him easier to be around with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pass me that cushion, would you?&#34; Goldie asked, her voice breaking the comfortable silence that had settled between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy obliged, handing her the embroidered cushion with a smile. &#34;Here you go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you nervous about the ritual? You haven&#39;t talked about it since that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, arranging the cushion on a wooden bench. &#34;I know. But I&#39;m not really nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy nodded. &#34;Okay... but like I said, you can back down anytime you want. It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was worrying too much. Too much about what she wanted and what she was thinking. &#34;In a way, I feel useful for playing such a huge part in the ritual. So don&#39;t worry about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then something crossed her mind and she decided to ask Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that why you never mentioned the Lunathion ritual? Did you even mention it before I lost my memories?!&#34;  She spoke carefully, so as to not make a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy&#39;s expression became neutral but he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our relationship before was not the smoothest. It didn&#39;t seem appropriate in any context to tell you about it then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded, she wasn&#39;t sure she understood what he meant but her question had been answered nonetheless. He didn&#39;t tell Valentina about the Lunathion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they continued arranging the room, their conversation drifted to more mundane topics. They talked about their favorite foods, childhood memories, and even shared a few embarrassing stories from their past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun dipped below the horizon and the room grew dimmer, they were finally done. They could finally leave the annex and go back inside to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>............</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie entered the gym, where the scent of polished equipment mixed with the faint aroma of lavender from the air freshener. She found Marielle waiting there, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, and a determined look in her eyes. She remembered when she told Marielle she wanted to train to be stronger, she didn&#39;t expect that Marielle would make the effort or be the one to call her to the gym first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her first time stepping into the gym and she didn&#39;t even know that they had a home gym until Remy had mentioned it in passing one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina, thanks for coming,&#34; Marielle said, patting the heavy bag. &#34;I remember you telling me you wanted to train, I think you&#39;ve had enough time to rest now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded, feeling a little uneasy. She had always admired the fact that Marielle could fight, but she couldn&#39;t help but wonder why Marielle had called her. She remembered vividly telling her the other day that she didn&#39;t like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle gestured to the gloves hanging on the wall. &#34;Put these on, Valentina. Today, I&#39;m going to teach you some self-defense moves. The first basics you learn are defense tactics and moves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie hesitated for a moment but then put on the gloves. She felt like she was about to be part of an action movie scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Marielle began demonstrating some basic punches and kicks, she threw in a few personal questions between moves. &#34;So, Valentina, tell me about you, do you really remember nothing?! I think your memories should be coming back by now, it&#39;s been quite a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie tried to concentrate on the training, but Marielle&#39;s questions were distracting. She paused mid-kick and looked at Marielle, her brow furrowing. &#34;No. They&#39;re not back. I still don&#39;t remember anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle paused, her expression unreadable. &#34;Not even one memory?! That&#39;s insane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie shook her head, feigning sadness. &#34;It&#39;s even more harder when people tell me things about myself and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not because I don&#39;t remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle resumed the training, but her questions continued. &#34;What about your phone? I&#39;m sure it must have some sort of clues. Did you look at it thoroughly?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie wondered why Marielle was asking her so many questions. It was very suspicious. &#34;I didn&#39;t find anything on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the training session went on, Goldie couldn&#39;t help but feel a growing suspicion. Marielle seemed to know something she wasn&#39;t sharing. There was a tense undercurrent to their conversation, and Goldie couldn&#39;t ignore it any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marielle,&#34; she said as she blocked a punch, &#34;do you know something that you&#39;re not telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle hesitated, her fists lowering. &#34;I think it would be best if you remember on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie&#39;s heart raced as she confronted her. &#34;Tell me, Marielle. I deserve to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle sighed, removing her gloves and walking closer to her. &#34;Well, with the attack and with what I found out, it appears that you were involved with a lot of shady people and you probably tried to run away from them. What your business was with them, I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s still a lot I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie&#39;s mind whirled with questions and fear. What could Valentina have been involved in that was so significant? As she gazed at Marielle, she realized that this unexpected training session was a farce, Marielle tried to see if she knew anything, that was her goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as Goldie, she didn&#39;t know anything and she didn&#39;t feel comfortable enough about telling Marielle about the journal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily Parson was alone. She felt more alone than ever since her husband had announced that he wanted a divorce and left the house. Worse, Nana was still missing from the nursing home. Her mother had vanished from the nursing home without a trace, leaving Lily in a state of perpetual worry. She was determined to file a police report the next morning morning, hoping that it would bring some answers. But as she gathered her things and prepared to leave, a knock at the door startled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily opened the door to find her Aunt Camilla standing there. She had not seen her aunt in a year, her aunt was meant to come to Goldie&#39;s funeral but her flight was canceled because of weather conditions. Aunt Camilla in a way reminded her of her mother, a younger version of her mother. With the same brown eyes, the wrinkles around her eyes and her dark blond hair that was splattered with grey hair. Concern was etched across Aunt Camilla&#39;s gentle face. &#34;Aunt Camilla, what are you doing here?&#34; Lily asked, surprised by the unexpected visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla embraced her niece tightly, holding her close as if trying to shield her from the harsh world. &#34;Lily, my dear, I had to come the minute I was in town. I couldn&#39;t bear to see you going through this alone,&#34; she said softly. &#34;I know how much you loved your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily&#39;s eyes welled up with tears at the mention of her daughter. Camilla&#39;s presence was a bittersweet reminder of the family&#39;s losses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla continued, her voice soothing, &#34;I came here to assure you that your mother is safe, Lily. She&#39;s on a special journey, and she will return to the nursing home once she&#39;s finished with her task. You must trust me on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily couldn&#39;t help but feel a glimmer of hope at her aunt&#39;s words, but she was also very confused. &#34;But, Aunt Camilla, where could she possibly be going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla offered a faint smile. &#34;Some things are beyond your understanding for now my dear. But you must trust me on this, your mother is fine and she wanted me to assure you that she is well and hearty. She will be back very soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lily wiped away her tears, she felt a sense of comfort wash over her. Perhaps her mother&#39;s disappearance wasn&#39;t as alarming as she had initially thought. Maybe her mother could use some time with her sister, maybe she wanted a break from the home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla then gently asked, &#34;May I see Goldie&#39;s room? I&#39;d like to spend a moment there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily nodded, grateful for the support of her aunt. She led Camilla to Goldie&#39;s room, and gave her some privacy. Camilla moved quietly through the room, her fingers trailing over mementos of Goldie&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to Lily, as Camilla appeared to be lost in her thoughts, she discreetly pocketed a few of Goldie&#39;s personal items-a small hairbrush with strands of her curly hair still on it, a pink tank top from her pile of dirty clothes that still smelled of her perfume and had her scent, and as she rummaged through her drawer, she found the last thing she was looking for, an amulet with a gold stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The amulet that Goldie was supposed to be wearing every time. The amulet that kept her soul in place. She must have not known it&#39;s use if she had taken it off, because she was never supposed to take it off. Camilla stuffed all this into her large purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments, Camilla came out of the room and turned to Lily, her eyes filled with pity for her niece. &#34;Thank you for letting me visit, Lily. It means the world to me,&#34; she said.</p>
