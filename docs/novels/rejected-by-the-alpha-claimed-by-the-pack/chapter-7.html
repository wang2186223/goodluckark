                <p>Fiona&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swore to God Isaac had been absolutely avoiding me for the last two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I asked him if he&#39;d been avoiding me for the past two days, and rightfully so, the answer was &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. However, with a woman&#39;s intuition, Isaac was definitely not right these two days. Usually I accompanied him to the training ground to watch the games, but these days he left early from class and went to training with his friends. And I couldn&#39;t get anything out of his friends. I even used the excuse of &amp;quot;introducing girls&amp;quot; to Kevin. Kevin just said they were really just going to practice together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been normal for Isaac to be surrounded by a lot of girls since he was a kid. Not to mention his distinguished status, Isaac&#39;s handsome appearance and perfectly proportioned body were enough to make them swoon. The normal girls who could only drool over Isaac only dared to look at him from afar. I enjoyed the feeling of &amp;quot;my Alpha&amp;quot; being admired by all. But as soon as one of them tried to go beyond the &amp;quot;admiration&amp;quot; line and actually do something. I would show them what fear was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snuck up on Isaac yesterday and followed him to an optician&#39;s shop. He seemed in a hurry, or he would have sensed someone was following him. An eyeglass shop? Werewolves had several times the vision of normal people, not to mention Isaac, so he certainly didn&#39;t buy them for himself, which set alarm bells ringing in my mind. I ruled out my close friends first. None of us needed glasses. Then the girls at school, it seemed that none of them were wearing glasses either...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie dragged me to the kitchen for afternoon tea and I had to go with her. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to tell her about my doubts, even though she was my friend. Isaac hated it when I did that, and he once warned me not to use him as an excuse to bully girls. But who let those girls seduce him first? Of course, I didn&#39;t dare to say such things out loud. Isaac didn&#39;t usually take such trivial things too seriously, but no one dared to ignore future Alpha&#39;s warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An exquisite afternoon tea was already on the table in the kitchen. I saw the traitor&#39;s daughter in the corner pulling books out of her tattered school bag. It was ridiculous. What did she want to see in books, her wolf? The sight of her pathetic appearance made me inwardly annoyed. I grabbed the bag out of her hand. The traitor&#39;s daughter obviously didn&#39;t expect my action. With a ringing crash in the process of grabbing her bag, a hard object fell to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to tell if shock or anger filled my brain first when I saw the glasses Isaac had bought fall out of her book bag. &amp;quot;Say! Where did this pair of glasses come from!&amp;quot; I swore I had got my volume pretty much under control, but it was hard to control my screaming when it came to such an annoying thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the traitor&#39;s daughter&#39;s mouth move, but I could no longer hear what she was saying at all. But I could be sure of one thing, and that was that Isaac hadn&#39;t given her the glasses. She was just a slave, the daughter of a traitor, and Isaac didn&#39;t even want to look at her, so how could he give her something? So she must have stolen them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What a shameless thief!&amp;quot; I pulled the slave&#39;s hair with my left hand and slapped her in the face with my right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie had absolutely no idea what was going on, but she was happy to fight the damn slave with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Look up at me!&amp;quot; I yanked the slave&#39;s hair to make her look straight at me, she could only look at me if she wanted to keep her scalp. Then I saw a pair of very beautiful eyes. Damn it! I wasn&#39;t going to use that word to describe any part of the slave&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t find any other words to describe eyes like that. It was like a lake deep in the forest, which was so pure and clean green color that made it easy to attract people&#39;s attention and fall deep into it. An indescribable emotion came over me. What made a slave? What made a slave have eyes like that? It reminded me easily of that day, when this slave was about to hit the corner of the table, Isaac immediately appeared to save her and held her in his arms, though only for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m not a thief.&amp;quot; The corner of the slave&#39;s mouth was still bleeding, which affected her pronunciation. She mumbled, &amp;quot;Isaac gave me the glasses.&amp;quot; Was she showing off? How dared she, a slave, brag in front of me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How dare you say Isaac&#39;s name!&amp;quot; I kicked her in the crotch and she lost her balance and fell to the ground. I was going to kill her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you the one who seduced Isaac?&amp;quot; I was going to gouge those creepy green eyes out of her! Anger rushed the blood all over my body to my brain and I put my hands around the slave&#39;s neck in a death grip. Ellie, who had been beside me, was terrified; she had never seen me so angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took all of Ellie&#39;s strength to pull me off the slave, and she yelled in my ear, &amp;quot;If you kill someone, Isaac will never talk to you again.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I calmed down a little then, as the slave lying on the floor coughed frantically and looked like she was about to break. Ellie was afraid I would explode again and rushed to pull me away. Before I left, I took the glasses in my hand and took them out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the damn glasses made me think of the slave&#39;s green eyes again. Now that they were Isaac&#39;s belongings, I had to make the most of them. So I broke them off and threw them in the path where Isaac always walked through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I was going to die just now. In fact, I would indeed have died if Ellie hadn&#39;t pulled Fiona away. I coughed for close to half an hour before I got over it, not feeling too much anger in my heart because I heard Fiona&#39;s voice when she forced me to look at her. &amp;quot;How can a slave have such beautiful eyes, what will I do if Isaac takes a liking to her?&amp;quot; How pathetic! I could clearly feel her jealousy to the point where her tongue was bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I packed up my school bag and it seemed that my glasses were missing. It didn&#39;t matter, I couldn&#39;t bring them with me anyway. Luckily, Fiona didn&#39;t have a penchant for tearing up books and I put them away carefully in my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the evening, Luna came to the kitchen to tell the staff that there was a very important party in a few days and that we should all prepare in advance. When she gave the order, her gaze stopped for a second as she looked at me, probably seeing the bruised pinch marks on my neck left by Fiona. I flinched and ducked my head even lower. Then Luna shifted her gaze to the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the basement, I applied the herbs to the pinch marks on my neck. Only then did I remember the purpose of tomorrow&#39;s party. Isaac was coming of age and he would have a mate of his. Not knowing what kind of person his mate would be, I thought about the few encounters I&#39;d had with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mate would stroke across the bridge of his high nose and look into his caramel eyes filled with tenderness. She would lean onto his warm and broad chest, when held close to him, the smell of ebony and cedar would linger in her nostrils. Then she would hear him whisper in her ears in a magnetic bass voice, saying that he loved her. Who could have such a mate as Isaac? His mate would most likely be the daughter of Alpha from what other packs, graceful and beautiful and powerful so as to be worthy of Isaac, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coming-of-age rite was near and my mother didn&#39;t bother to hide it now; she used to just ask me sideways about any girls I liked. Now she was throwing a straightforward party for me to find my mate. According to her, the party would invite many girls from prominent families. It would be a lie to say that I wasn&#39;t curious, there was no one who wasn&#39;t looking forward to their mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was walking to school, I couldn&#39;t blame my eyes for being too good, it was just that this thing looked very familiar. Very few werewolves wore glasses, so a pair tossed on the side of the road, which was broken off, caught my eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is clearly the pair I gave her! How dare she throw away what I gave her?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The girl looks not like the kind to just throw things around.&amp;quot; Caesar tried to defend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have been nice to her out of good intentions, but she didn&#39;t value it at all. She&#39;d better stay out of my face from now on. I won&#39;t mind her business anymore.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back at Claudia&#39;s innocent green eyes, I felt betrayal and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been too good to the slave these days and made her forget who she was！</p>
