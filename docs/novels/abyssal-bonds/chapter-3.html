                <p>The alarms blared through the Genesis, drowning out any other sound. On the main screen, the sonar display confirmed a handful of large things in quick succession. The tension in the control room became electric, with each breath sharp and every movement hastened. However, in the middle of the pandemonium, Sophia&#39;s attention became focused on the person who had previously been a dragon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood unnervingly still, water trickling from his body. His golden eyes were filled with depth as he met Sophia&#39;s gaze. &#34;They&#39;re here for me,&#34; he said sincerely, his voice low but with basic weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clinched her fist. &#34;Who? &#34;What are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips twisted into a small smile, but it was devoid of humor. &#34;You&#39;re not equipped for that answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could demand any more, the delivery jerked severely. Sparks fell from the ceiling as systems failed one by one. Liam gripped the edge of a console to support himself while shouting instructions to the others. &#34;Prepare for the effect! &#34;Everyone to the emergency stations!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia tripped but kept her eyes on the person. &#34;If they&#39;re here for you, what can we do? How do you fight them off? Run?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may not be able to outrun them,&#34; he added, edging closer. &#34;however you might live on-in case you pay attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s irritability boiled over. &#34;Concentrate on what?&#34; &#34;You are speaking to me in riddles!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression softened slightly, but his tone remained firm. &#34;To the ocean.&#34; To the part of you that is aware.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit a nerve, an echo of something Sophia couldn&#39;t quite grasp but felt deeply. Before she could respond, the delivery rocked again. A low, guttural noise rippled through the water-not from the Genesis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next few hours went in a blur. The beings, which the person had referred to as &#34;hunters,&#34; circled the spacecraft but did not assault. As a substitute, their presence loomed, an unspoken opportunity that kept everyone on track. By the time the fear subsided, the group was exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia sat alone in her quarters, the hum of the ship&#39;s backup systems providing a faint historical background noise. Her thoughts turned into a barrage of unanswered questions. Who transformed into he? What were the hunters&#39; names? And why did she feel connected to everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes, wanting to relax, but the moment she slept off, the urges began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first dream became fragmented, like pieces of a puzzle dispersed across her consciousness. She stood on the deck of the Genesis, but the water was unlike anything she had ever seen. The lake shimmered with light, its surface vibrant with color. Shapes flowed beneath it, huge, serpentine figures that danced like shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice that goes by her name. Deep, resonant, and hauntingly familiar. She became, but no one else did. The voice appeared again, this time softer. It was no longer merely a call; it had become a guide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked down at her hands. They shone faintly, the mild spread across her skin in intricate patterns that felt as natural as breathing. She raised her hand to the sea, and the water surged in answer, reaching for her like an old friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could contact anything, the scene changed. Darkness devoured the gentle, and the dazzling ocean turned bloodless and lifeless. A pair of golden eyes appeared in the nothingness, peering at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve forgotten who you&#39;re,&#34; the voice said. It wasn&#39;t accusatory; it had shifted to sorrowful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia awoke with a start, her heart racing. She sat up and walked a hand through her hair. The radiance she had seen in the dream persisted in her thoughts, brilliant and unshakeable. It was not just a dream. It turned into a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned to the lab the next day, attempting to shake off the dream and refocus on the current issue. The individual-Tharros, as he later revealed-was now housed in a guarded statement room. Despite the obvious hazards, she persisted on being the one to confront him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she entered, Tharros stood near the observation window, gazing out at the sea. He felt himself as majestic and untouchable, just as he did in dragon form. His skull got thin as she approached, recognizing her presence before she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re no longer human,&#34; Sophia said, her voice firm despite the storm of emotions swirling inside her. &#34;That tonnage is evident. But what are you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grew to be able to stand her completely, his golden eyes matching hers. &#34;you already know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s jaw stiffened. &#34;Do not do that. Don&#39;t address me as if I were a participant in a sport. I haven&#39;t realized anything about this... about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros took a step forward, his presence filling the space. &#34;You can&#39;t recall now, but it&#39;s in you. &#34;I felt it the moment we met.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you speakme approximately?&#34; She demanded, frustration in her voice. &#34;Why do I feel... related to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze softened, and for a fleeting moment, she sensed something vulnerable beneath his unshakeable exterior. &#34;due to the fact you&#39;re.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s breath tightened. She examined his face for ideas, but before she could press more, alarms sounded once more. Her stomach sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam&#39;s voice arrived on the intercom. &#34;Sophia, we have a scenario. You need to get to the management room. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed at Tharros, torn between remaining and leaving. He nodded toward the door. &#34;cross. &#34;We will talk later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reluctantly turned and ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the control room, anarchy ensued. The sonar came alive with interest, but nothing appeared on the displays. Sophia approached Liam, who began typing furiously at the console.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s occurring?&#34; She requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the anomaly again,&#34; he replied, not looking up. &#34;But this time, it&#39;s everywhere. &#34;It&#39;s as if the ocean is responding to something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gazed over the data. The measurements have been irregular, with bursts of energy emanating from all directions. Her thoughts raced. If Tharros become tied to the anomaly, is this also linked to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the thought entered her mind, another remembrance surfaced-a flashback to her dream. The brilliant patterns on her skin, and how the water had reached for her. It wasn&#39;t just a coincidence. It was a clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to head lower back to him,&#34; she stated abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Liam gazed at her, as if she had misplaced her ideas. &#34;Sophia, we&#39;re in the middle of-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need solutions,&#34; she interrupted him. &#34;And he has them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could protest further, she had already left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Sophia reentered Tharros&#39; chamber, he turned to look for her, his expression unreadable. She didn&#39;t spend any time. &#34;What is going on right now? What does it have to do with you-or me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros looked her over for a second before speaking. &#34;Have you felt it? &#34;The pull.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia hesitated but nodded. &#34;In my desires.&#34; And when I&#39;m around you, it&#39;s overwhelming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew closer, his voice low and steady. &#34;Because it is waking up.&#34; &#34;And so are you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse quickened. &#34;What&#39;s waking up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; golden eyes darkened somewhat, as if the weight of his solution bothered him. &#34;The sea&#39;s heart.&#34; The energy that connects my type, your type, and the arena above together. It has been inactive for centuries, but something has changed. Something is rousing it from its slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shakes her head. &#34;That does not make sense. &#34;I&#39;m just... human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros inclined his head, a small smirk forming on his lips. &#34;You&#39;re not your usual self, Sophia. &#34;You would not have found me otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phrases weighed heavily in the air. Sophia&#39;s thoughts reeled, but a small, unshakable part of her knew he was correct. The dreams, the feelings, the relationship-they were not coincidental. It was futuristic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ship jerked, cutting off connection quickly. Tharros&#39; expression became stern. &#34;They&#39;re coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach twisted. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t respond. Alternatively, he moved closer to the observation window, his eyes narrowing as if he could see into the depths. &#34;You&#39;ll find out soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lighting flickered, and the room filled with the same deep, resonant hum Sophia had previously experienced. Her skin prickled, and the shimmering patterns from her dream appeared to burn themselves into her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was coming, and she wasn&#39;t prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turbulent Depths</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waves trembled deep beneath the surface of Aquaria, the enormous bioluminescent empire. Kael Stormwind, commander of the royal defense, stood on the entrance of the crystalline courtyard, his piercing blue eyes studying the shifting ocean currents. Something went wrong. He should feel it: an interruption in the glide, like a pulse out of sync.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, the capital city bloomed in its usual brilliance. Coral towers spiraled into the sea&#39;s surface, their herbal glow throwing soothing light on bustling streets. But beneath the veneer of routine, uneasiness permeated Aquaria. Whispers about Tharros&#39; departure had begun to spread, and Kael understood what that meant: instability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael,&#34; a harsh, demanding voice called. He grew to see Arin Blacktide, the mysterious sea witch, coming. Her dark hair swirled around her like a living shadow, and her violet eyes narrowed with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin,&#34; he said, his voice clipped. He respected her authority but questioned her motivations, which she reciprocated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You experience it as well,&#34; she added, more of a proclamation than a question. &#34;The king is long past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s jaws constricted. &#34;He will go back. &#34;He always does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is extraordinary,&#34; Arin replied quietly. &#34;The water itself is stressed. &#34;You already understand what that means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael hated admitting it, but she was right. The sea&#39;s enchantment became linked to Tharros&#39; presence. Without him, the delicate balance of Aquaria&#39;s ecosystem-and its politics-were threatened. &#34;What do you want, Arin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To behave,&#34; she said really, stepping closer. &#34;You will be pleased to sit here and brood, but I am not. If Tharros is under attack, we cannot sit idly by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael crossed his palms with a stern face. &#34;And risk a complete scale panic? No. Human beings must believe their king is safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lies won&#39;t keep them safe from what&#39;s coming,&#34; Arin said again, her tone stern. &#34;The Shark Clans are already stirring. The Whale Seers&#39; forecasts become darker by the day. &#34;How long do you think we have before chaos takes hold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael didn&#39;t respond. Instead, he became one with the currents, his mind whirling. Arin was not wrong. Tensions between the Shark Clans had been simmering for years, and without Tharros&#39; power to keep them at bay, conflict seemed imminent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council chamber of the royal palace was filled with discontent. Representatives from each side fought over how to proceed in Tharros&#39; absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to mobilize the military,&#34; a Shark extended family emissary hissed, his sharp teeth glinting in the light. &#34;The king&#39;s withdrawal is a sign of weakness. If we do not act now, our adversaries will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enemies?&#34; A Dolphin Pod diplomat snapped, her tone incredulous. &#34;The simplest risk here is your bloodthirsty ambition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sufficient,&#34; Kael said as he entered the chamber. His authoritative presence immediately quiet the room. &#34;The infighting serves no purpose. Our primary focus must be on maintaining order until the king returns.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what if he doesn&#39;t?&#34; The Shark ambassador answered, his voice filled with determination. &#34;What then, Commander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s fists clenched, but his voice remained consistent. &#34;He will return.&#34; Until then, I propose that you remember who controls the command in his absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emissary&#39;s eyes narrowed, but he said nothing more. Kael began to focus his attention on the council&#39;s relaxation. &#34;Tharros&#39;s absence is temporary. Our job is to protect Aquaria, not destroy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room sank into an uncomfortable silence. Kael surveyed the faces in front of him, noting the combination of terror and mistrust. This wasn&#39;t just about Tharros; it was about the existence of their entire country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Kael found himself in the throne room, his previous position being that of an empty seat of energy. The silence became deafening, broken only by the gentle buzz of the paranormal wards that protected the palace. He felt the weight of obligation bear down on him, more than it had ever been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may not keep this collectively to yourself,&#34; Arin&#39;s voice reverberated out behind him. He did not turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a preference,&#34; he said, his voice weary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do,&#34; she said, striding into view. &#34;You just refuse to admit it. &#34;We are stronger together, Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a sideways glance. &#34;And what could you expect me to do?&#34; Plan a coup? take the throne in Tharros&#39; absence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin smirked slightly. &#34;Do not be theatrical. I propose we work together-for Aquaria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s gaze hardened. &#34;I&#39;ll consider it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin tilted her head, examining him. &#34;You are afraid. Now it&#39;s not about the Shark Clans or the council, but something deeper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t respond, but her remarks hit a nerve. She became decent. anything about Tharros&#39;s absence felt incorrect-like a little of himself turned into lacking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the palace grappled with political instability, the deep sea tunnels shook with a darker force. Creatures long forgotten by human records began to rise, drawn by an imbalance of energy. Whispers of an ancient evil travelled through the submerged nation-states, carried by currents that froze the blood of those who heard them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s divination pool in her coral tower lit up softly as she performed her charms. The photographs appeared to be broken and traumatic, depicting shadowy beings and dazzling eyes, as well as an ocean split apart by struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Display me, Tharros,&#34; she muttered, her palms floating above the water. The pool&#39;s surface rippled, and for a brief moment, she saw him-certain and constrained, encircled by light and metal. However, before she could distinguish anything, the vision faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin tightened her hands, frustrated. Whatever she did to keep Tharros became effective, but she couldn&#39;t decide what it was. She wanted for better records-and faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Kael roamed the village, providing confidence to the locals. Despite his confident demeanor, doubt gnawed at him. The Shark Clans were mobilizing, with warriors gathering along the border. The Whale Seers&#39; songs had grown to be melancholy, and their predictions spoke of a reckoning that would forever change the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael understood he couldn&#39;t keep Aquaria together on his own. But trusting Arin-a witch with her own timeline-felt like a bet. Nonetheless, the decision will not be his to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, when the currents slowed and the city fell into a restless slumber, Kael stood at the capital&#39;s threshold, peering into the unknown. The water here was colder and darker, as if it concealed secrets and tactics that no one dared to explore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small gleam caught his vision, and his breathing quickened. It became ephemeral, but unmistakable-the same gentleness that had enveloped Tharros. Kael&#39;s pulse quickened. He wasn&#39;t long gone. Not completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, Arin appeared, her look unreadable. &#34;You felt it, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded, his jaw tightened. &#34;He&#39;s alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now,&#34; she answered bitterly. &#34;however if we don&#39;t act soon, he received&#39;t be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael turned to face her fully, his determination sharpening. &#34;Then we act. together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s lips were endowed with an exceptional smile. &#34;eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as they prepared to seek for their monarch, the shadows in the trenches increased. Something ancient stirred, its waking linked to Tharros&#39; absence-and its gaze was fixed on Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking Barriers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood inside the lab, arms crossed, staring at the glass enclosure in which Tharros was imprisoned. Despite everything-his change, his cryptic language, the hunters circling outside-he remained unnervingly calm, like a predator biding its time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run the final series,&#34; she said Liam, her voice taut with recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure approximately this?&#34; Liam asked, his hands leaping over the controls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have a preference,&#34; Sophia responded. &#34;We want to recognize what we&#39;re handling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the test began, the room became energized. A low hum hung in the air, and the advanced sensors inside the chamber lit up as they attempted to study Tharros&#39; electrical discipline. Sophia kept her gaze fixated on his, searching for any signs of emotion, but his golden eyes remained constant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you hoping to locate?&#34; Tharros inquired abruptly, his husky voice reduced by the hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia blinked, surprised. He hadn&#39;t talked since the experiment began. &#34;Answers,&#34; she responded, defying her discomfort. &#34;Who are you? &#34;What are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros inclined his head, a small smirk forming on his lips. &#34;And if you don&#39;t like what you locate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll deal with it,&#34; she replied firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sneer broadened, but he said nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The readings on the console soared without warning. Alarms blared, and the glass chamber around Tharros began to light softly. Liam grumbled under his breath while attempting to adjust the device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;close it down!&#34; Sophia yelled, racing to the console.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m trying, but it&#39;s no longer responding!&#34; Liam yelled again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; expression changed within the chamber, from a smirk to something more sinister. His eyes shone brighter, and the power around him grew, crackling like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt a shiver go down her spine. This was not just a response; he was doing it. &#34;Tharros, stop!&#34; she commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted his look to her, and for a brief moment, she saw something primordial in his eyes. &#34;You desired solutions, Sophia,&#34; he replied, his voice calm but powerful. &#34;permit me display you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The power of the explosion knocked Sophia off her feet. She landed hard on the floor, knocking the air out of her lungs. While she looked up, Tharros emerged, standing in the center of the room, the brilliance of his strength casting long shadows on the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crew tried to recover, with some escaping and others shouting instructions. Liam reached for the emergency containment controls, but Tharros lifted a hand, causing the console to spark furiously, rendering it useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia pushed herself to stand, her heart hammering. &#34;You don&#39;t have to do this,&#34; she replied, her voice calm despite the commotion around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros looked to her with an enigmatic expression. &#34;You do not understand, Sophia. I am not your prisoner. &#34;I am your answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could process his statements, he moved-fast, incredibly quickly. In a blink, he was in front of her. The section shifted as he put his arm around her waist and sprang through the enormous hole in the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frigid water swallowed her, taking away her breath. Sophia&#39;s instincts urged her to resist, but Tharros&#39; grip became immovable. They sank lower, the Genesis disappearing into space as the sea engulfed them whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia fought towards him, her movements frenzied, but his voice reached her, calm and steady despite the water. &#34;Sophie, stop fighting. Breathe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, terror spreading. Breathe? Is he insane?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider me,&#34; he whispered, his golden eyes fixed on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia paused, then hesitantly took a tiny breath. To her surprise, the water moved effortlessly into her lungs, almost like air. She gasped as she realized she could breathe underwater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What... how?&#34; She maintained control, her voice thin and incredulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros did not offer a solution. As a substitute, he tightened his grasp and propelled them forward with an efficient kick that slashed through the water like a blade. The currents considered the element for him and bent to his desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes-or perhaps hours-passed before they eventually slowed. Tharros launched her, and Sophia floated in the still water, recovering her breath. The sea around them had darkened and become numerous, but an unexplainable warmth held the sat back at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not human,&#34; Sophia said, her voice wavering from terror and surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Tharros replied actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what are you?&#34; She pressed. &#34;Why take me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swam closer, his presence overwhelming despite the immensity of the ocean. &#34;Because you are no longer what you thought you were studying, Sophia. You do not belong in that world. &#34;You belong in mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her coronary heart raced. &#34;What are you speakme about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; glare softened somewhat, and for the first time, she saw something other than power in his eyes. There has been a profound and historic letdown. I was interested in you, Sophia. Simply because you have shown interest in me. It is not a twist of fate. &#34;It is destiny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shook her head, her mind reeling. &#34;That doesn&#39;t make sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will,&#34; he answered. &#34;but first, I need you to believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia paused. Each instinct told her to run, fight, or do something other than cooperate with this guy-this dragon. However, something deeper, more primordial, directed her to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why me?&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros smiled faintly, a glimmer of warmth bursting through his austere façade. &#34;because you&#39;re the handiest one who can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could react, the water around them shook. A deep, resonant hum echoed throughout the ocean, becoming louder by the second. Tharros&#39; expression hardened, and his body tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ve found us,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach sank. &#34;The hunters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;live close to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, he seized her hand and pulled her farther into the waves. The water became chillier, the pleasant diminishing until they were engulfed by blackness. However, even in the pitch black, Tharros&#39; presence transformed into a lighthouse, his golden eyes directing her on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hum intensified, and Sophia felt the water vibrate across her skin. Then, out of the darkness, shapes appeared: sleek, terrifying bureaucracy that moved with lethal precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Live in the back of me,&#34; Tharros told his voice corporation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia complied, her coronary heart pounding in her chest. The hunters closed in, their bright gaze locked on Tharros. He stood on his floor, his strength radiating around him like a shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lead hunter struck with startling velocity. Tharros moved faster, confronting the onslaught head on. The intensity of the collision sent shockwaves through the water, nearly knocking Sophia off balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked in awe and dread as Tharros fought, his movements a flurry of strength and skill. The hunts were relentless, but he kept his ground, protecting her with each attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, it was not adequate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the hunters broke through, aiming directly for Sophia. She froze, terror paralyzing her. Tharros turned, his golden eyes widening as he saw the threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was nowhere to run.</p>
