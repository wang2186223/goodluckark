                <p>Her question hung in the air, suspended somewhere between truth and lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clip of boots against the pristine tile forced my eyes up, away from the doctor&#39;s face. Each step was a warning, and I knew they were coming before Dr. Begbie turned her head. She moved to push herself away from the bed, but I didn&#39;t let her. I don&#39;t know what possessed me, but I grabbed her wrist, the list of punishments for touching an authority figure running through my head like a skipping CD, each scratch sharper than the next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We weren&#39;t supposed to touch anyone, not even each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was different this time,&#34; I whispered, the words aching in my throat. My voice sounded different to my ears. Weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Begbie only had enough time to nod. The slightest movement, almost imperceptible, before a hand ripped back the curtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had seen this Psi Special Forces officer before-Sam called him the Grinch, because he looked like he had stepped straight out of the movie, save for no green skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Grinch cast one look at me, his top lip peeling back in annoyance, before waving the doctor forward. She blew out a sigh and set her clipboard down on my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Ruby,&#34; she said. &#34;If your pain gets any worse, call for help, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she on drugs? Who was going to help-the kid throwing up his stomach lining next door?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded anyway, watching her turn to go. The last glimpse I had of her was her hand dragging the curtain back around. It was nice of her to give me privacy, but a little naive, given the black cameras hanging down between the beds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bulbs were installed all over Thurmond, lidless eyes always watching, never blinking. There were two cameras in our cabin alone, one on each end of the room, as well as one outside the door. It seemed like overkill, but when I was first brought to camp, there were so few of us that they really could watch us all day, every day, until their brains were ready to burst from boredom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You had to squint to see it, but a tiny red light inside the black eye was the only clue that the camera had zeroed in on you. Over the years, as more and more kids were brought into Thurmond on the old school buses, Sam and I began to notice that the cameras in our cabin no longer had the blinking red lights-not every day. Same went for the cameras in the laundry, the Washrooms, and the Mess Hall. I guess with three thousand kids spread out over a square mile, it was impossible to watch everyone all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, they watched enough to put the fear of God in us. You had a better-than-average chance of being busted if you practiced your abilities, even under the cover of darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those blinking lights were the exact same shade as the blood-red band the PSFs wore around the upper part of their right arm. The Ψ symbol was stitched on the crimson fabric, indicating their unfortunate role as caretakers of the country&#39;s freak children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera above my bed had no red light. The relief that came over me at the realization actually made the air taste sweet. For just a moment, I was alone and unobserved. At Thurmond, that was an almost unheard-of luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Begbie-Cate-hadn&#39;t completely closed the curtain. When another doctor hurried past, the thin white fabric pulled back farther, allowing a familiar flash of blue to catch my eye. The portrait of a young boy, no more than twelve years old, stared back at me. His hair was the same shade as mine-deep brown, nearly black-but where my eyes were pale green, his were dark enough to burn from a distance. He was smiling, as always, his hands clasped in his lap, his dark school uniform without a wrinkle. Clancy Gray, Thurmond&#39;s first inmate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were at least two framed pictures of him in the Mess Hall, one in the kitchen, several nailed outside of the Green outhouses. It was easier to remember his face than it was to remember my mom&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to look away from his proud, unwavering grin. He may have gotten out, but the rest of us were still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I tried to readjust my body, I knocked Dr. Begbie&#39;s clipboard off my lap and into the crook of my left arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew there was a chance that they were watching, but I didn&#39;t care. Not then, when I had answers inches away from my fingertips. Why had she left it there, right below my nose, if she hadn&#39;t wanted me to see it? Why hadn&#39;t she taken it with her, like all of the other doctors would have done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was different about the White Noise?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did they figure out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fluorescent lights above me were exposed, glowing in the shape of long, angry bones. They gave off a hum, sounding more and more like a cloud of flies swirling around my ears. It only got worse as I flipped the clipboard over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t my medical history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t my current injuries, or lack thereof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t my answers to Dr. Begbie&#39;s questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a note, and it read: New CC was testing for undetected Ys, Os, Rs. Your bad reaction means that they know you aren&#39;t G. Unless you do exactly as I say, they will kill you tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands were shaking. I had to set the clipboard down in my lap to read the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can get you out. Take the two pills under this note before bed, but don&#39;t let the PSFs see you. If you don&#39;t, will keep your secret, but I can&#39;t protect you while you&#39;re in here. Destroy this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was signed, A friend, if you&#39;d like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I read the note one more time before I ripped it out from under the metal clip and shoved it in my mouth. It tasted like the bread they served us for lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pills were in a tiny clear bag clipped on top of my real medical chart. Scrawled in Dr. Begbie&#39;s dismal handwriting was the note, Subject 3285 hit her head against the ground and lost consciousness. Nose was fractured when Subject 3286 elbowed her. Possible concussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were itching to look up, to peer into the black eye of the camera, but I didn&#39;t let myself. I took the pills and shoved them into the standard-issue sports bra the camp controllers had bestowed on us when they realized fifteen hundred teenage girls weren&#39;t going to stay twelve and flat forever. I didn&#39;t know what I was doing; I really didn&#39;t. My heart was racing so fast that for a moment I couldn&#39;t get any air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had Dr. Begbie done this to me? She knew I wasn&#39;t Green, but she had covered it up, lied on the report-was this just a trick? To see if I would incriminate myself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my face into my hands. The packet of pills burned against my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>they will kill you tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did they even bother to wait? Why not take me out to the buses and shoot me now? Isn&#39;t that what they did with the others? The Yellows, Oranges, and Reds? They killed them, because they were too dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am too dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how to use my abilities. I wasn&#39;t like the other Oranges, who could spout off commands or slip nasty little thoughts into other people&#39;s minds. I had all of the power, and none of the control-all of the pain, and none of the benefits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what I&#39;d been able to figure out, I had to touch someone for my abilities to take hold, and even thenit was more like I was glimpsing their thoughts, rather than screwing with them. I&#39;d never tried to push a thought into someone else&#39;s head, and it wasn&#39;t like I&#39;d had the opportunity or the desire to try. Every slip of the mind, intentional or not, left my head a jumble of thoughts and images, words and pain. It took hours to feel like myself again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Imagine someone reaching straight into your chest, past the bones and blood and guts, and taking a nice firm hold on your spinal cord. Now imagine that they start shaking you so fast the world starts bulging and buckling under you. Imagine not being able to figure out later if the thought in your head is really yours or an unintentional keepsake from someone else&#39;s mind. Imagine the guilt of knowing you saw someone&#39;s deepest, darkest fear or secret; imagine having to face them the next morning and pretend you didn&#39;t see how their father used to hit them, the bright pink dress they wore to their fifth birthday party, their fantasies about this boy or that girl, and the neighborhood animals they used to kill for fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then imagine the soul-crushing migraine that always follows, lasting anywhere between a few hours and a few days. That was what it was like. That was why I tried to avoid my mind so much as brushing up against someone else&#39;s at all costs. I knew the consequences. All of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now I knew for certain what would happen if they found me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flipped the clipboard over on my lap, and just in time. The same PSF soldier was back at my curtain again, ripping it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be returning to your cabin now,&#34; he said. &#34;Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cabin? I searched his face for any sign of a lie, but saw nothing except the usual annoyance. A nod was the only thing I could muster. My entire body was one earthquake of dread, and the moment my feet touched the ground, the back of my head uncorked. Everything spilled out, every thought, fear, and image. I collapsed against the guardrail, holding on tight to consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The black spots were still gliding in front of my eyes when the PSF barked out, &#34;Hurry it up! Don&#39;t think you get to stay another night here just by putting on an act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the harsh words, I saw the slightest flicker of fear in his face. That moment, the shift from fear to fury, could have summed up the feelings of every soldier at Thurmond. We&#39;d heard rumors that service in the military was no longer voluntary, that everyone between the ages of twenty-two and forty had to serve-most of them in the army&#39;s new Psi branch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth. The whole wide world spun under me, trying to pull me back down to its dark center. The PSF&#39;s words returned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another night? I thought. How long have I been here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still woozy, I followed the soldier into the hallway. The Infirmary was only two stories, small ones. The ceiling crept down so low that even I felt like I was in danger of scraping the top of my head on the doorframes. The treatment beds were on the first floor, but the second was reserved for kids needing to go into what we called Time Out. Sometimes they had something the rest of us could catch, but mostly it was for kids that went completely off their rocker, broken brains broken further by Thurmond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to stay focused on the movement of the PSF&#39;s shoulder blades beneath his black uniform, but it was difficult when most of the curtains had been left open for anyone to peer inside. Most I could ignore, or cast only a brief glance their way, but the second to last stall before the exit doors</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet slowed of their own accord, giving my lungs time to breathe in the scent of rosemary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear Dr. Begbie&#39;s gentle voice as she spoke to another kid in Green. I recognized him-his cabin was directly across from mine. Matthew? Maybe Max? All I knew was that there was blood on his face, too. Crusted around his nose and eyes, smearing across his checks. A stone dropped in my stomach. Had this Green been marked too? Was Dr. Begbie cutting him the same deal? I couldn&#39;t have been the only one to figure out how to dodge the sorting system-who to influence, when to lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he and I were the same color beneath our skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe we would both be dead by tomorrow.</p>
