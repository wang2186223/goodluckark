                <p>There was absolutely no way for Tapiwa to disappear and avoid the confrontation she saw brewing in the air as Asher closed the small distance between the door and their table. That didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa shot to her feet so fast, that her knees knocked against the table and sent it rocking unsteadily. In horror, Tapiwa watched as Nicole reached for their tall cups of slushies, but she was too slow. The cups toppled over. Two giant splats landed on the floor a second later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Tapiwa&#39;s guardian angel was clearly boycotting her duties, Tapiwa received a good amount of the colorful cold ice on her pumps. The sudden touch of cold made her yelp and jump back, almost losing her balance. But before the universe could decide if it was going to complete her humiliation with her ass on the floor, strong hands captured her forearms and steadied her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had happened so fast. Her heart thundering in her chest, she drew a sharp breath and held on to Asher as though her life depended on it. Blood rushing to her head filled her ears with a buzzing sound that drowned out all other noise for a few precious seconds. Then it all slammed back into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jesus! Tapi, are you okay?&#34; Nicole shouted as she stepped over the mess on the floor and practically ripped Tapiwa out of Asher&#39;s arms to hold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still a little dazed, Tapiwa didn&#39;t answer immediately. She blinked at her friend and then turned her head and stared at Asher who was addressing a frantic young man attempting to clean up the mess she had caused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mortification of what she had caused suddenly made her too warm and Tapiwa cringed. Damn. Where was the power of invisibility when you desperately needed it? She thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey?&#34; Nicole said, sounding very worried. She gently squeezed Tapiwa&#39;s arms until Tapiwa turned and gave her friend her full attention. &#34;What the hell is going on? What did he do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa opened her mouth to respond, but Asher was back with them. &#34;What did who do?&#34; Asher demanded with a frown creasing his perfect brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher was a good-looking man. In a Trevor Noah sort of way with an average soft body. He was taller than the both of them and had a lighter skin tone. When they had first met, Tapiwa had been captivated and flattered that a guy like him was interested in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that she was a troll. No. Tapiwa just never had much luck in the dating department. It had probably had something to do with the fact that she kept to herself. Or perhaps it had everything to do with her elder brother scaring off anyone who looked at her twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Asher, it had been different. For one thing, he hadn&#39;t minded that Tapiwa had been minding her own business, walking home from work, and had refused his offer for a ride. He had returned the next day and the day after until she gave in and smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lute, her brother, hadn&#39;t blown a gasket either when he found out about Asher. Neither had her father. However, Tapiwa suspected that had everything to do with the fact that it turned out Asher Paterson was the son of Angela Paterson, Tapiwa&#39;s mother&#39;s friend. And that relation was what made everything so much worse now for Tapiwa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Asher just been a nobody with no connection to friends of her parents, she would have dumped him as soon as she arrived home after the party. They had only been dating for a little over three months. There wasn&#39;t much in the way of a connection between them. He was good-looking, had a sense of humor, and could be quite the gentleman. Given time, Tapiwa knew she would have developed something more for him. But that wouldn&#39;t happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole released Tapiwa and moved to stand in front of her, shielding Tapiwa from Asher. It was kind of hilarious since Tapiwa had a few inches on Nicole, but her friend had more body mass. Her friend looked like a pit bull facing an intruder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension vibrated in the air even as Nicole pointed a finger at Asher and snarled. &#34;What did you do?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A confused look flashed across Asher&#39;s face. He looked at Tapiwa over Nicole&#39;s head. &#34;Is this about the other night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do!&#34; Nicole bellowed, obviously taking Asher&#39;s words as confirmation the man had done something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing they were drawing attention and the matter was escalating faster than she could blink, Tapiwa stepped around Nicole and squeezed herself between her friend and Asher. Facing Nicole, Tapiwa hurried to clear the misunderstanding. &#34;Nicole, relax. He didn&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Nicole wasn&#39;t buying it. Her narrowed eyes landed on Tapiwa. &#34;Don&#39;t lie for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m not. We went to the party. Asher-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I left her alone,&#34; Asher cut in suddenly. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I know that&#39;s why you are upset with me. That was really shitty of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa didn&#39;t know if she had ever been more happy to hear a man make the situation about himself. It was the perfect explanation, and she didn&#39;t bother refuting it. Tapiwa nodded, still looking at Nicole. &#34;Yes. That&#39;s what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole&#39;s gaze grew suspicious. She pursed her lips and shot a look at Asher before focusing back on Tapiwa. &#34;Are you sure?&#34; she asked in a lower voice as though she didn&#39;t want Asher to hear her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying to her closest friend wasn&#39;t what Tapiwa wanted to do. But under the circumstances, she had to. She couldn&#39;t blurt it all right there that she had somehow gotten drunk and ended up in bed with a stranger after Asher got lost in the party and forgot he had brought his girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Tapiwa thought about it, she had every right to be pissed off with Asher. If he hadn&#39;t abandoned her, she would never have ended up in bed with a stranger. But then again, she would have probably ended up under Asher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made her shudder. Not because she found him repulsive, but she just hadn&#39;t yet gotten to that point regardless of all the hints he had been giving her that he wanted her in bed. Maybe that was the reason he had even taken her to the party. To loosen her up a little. Well, the plan had worked but some unknown man had reaped the rewards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still couldn&#39;t remember what had happened and, in a way, she was grateful. Tapiwa wasn&#39;t sure she wanted to have a vivid memory of that night, even though she couldn&#39;t get the image of the stranger out of her head and she didn&#39;t feel hate or anger toward him. It was strange, she couldn&#39;t explain it. But that was how she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole touched Tapiwa&#39;s arm, snapping her out of her wandering thoughts. She immediately remembered her friend had asked her a question. Tapiwa nodded and forced a reassuring smile on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I&#39;m sure. Asher didn&#39;t do anything other than leave me alone after we got to the party. I got tired of waiting for him and I left not long after.&#34; The lie came out so smoothly, that it almost scared Tapiwa, but again, she was glad she could just give her friend some version of the truth that would hopefully be enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, after a beat, it seemed Nicole thought it was enough. She gave Tapiwa a nod and then glared at Asher. &#34;So, what do you want? To grovel for forgiveness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I could have a word in private with Tapiwa?&#34; There was a note of impatience in Asher&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa suppressed a flinch. She kept the smile on her face and gave Nicole another nod and then leaned forward and kissed her friend&#39;s cheek and gave her a hug. &#34;It&#39;s fine. My lunch break is almost done. Asher can walk me back to work as we talk. I will talk to you later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Sure,&#34; Nicole answered after a beat. Then she walked out of the eatery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A handful of seconds passed in silence, and then Tapiwa ignored the uncomfortable wetness now clinging to her foot and made her way out of the eatery as well. Asher was right there on her heels. They made their way to the road even though she could see Asher&#39;s car parked in the car park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really am sorry,&#34; Asher said after a minute of silence only broken by the sounds of traffic and people going about their normal lives. &#34;I got carried away with my friends and I honestly thought you would be okay with the girls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa couldn&#39;t remember any girls, but she wasn&#39;t going to say that. &#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; she gritted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher turned his head and gave her a boyish smile. &#34;So you forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; What else was Tapiwa supposed to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Asher had Tapiwa in a hug and he pecked her shocked, parted lips. &#34;Thanks, babe. I will make it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapiwa placed her palms against Asher&#39;s chest and tried to gently extract herself from his hold. &#34;That&#39;s not necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Asher was having none of it. &#34;Of course it is. In fact, that&#39;s why I tracked you down today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An excited gleam entered his eyes that had Tapiwa tense with apprehension. She pushed a little harder against his chest and he let her go, seemingly not conscious of the stiffness in her muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to invite you to a family dinner. It&#39;s next week. My brother&#39;s twenty-seventh birthday celebration. It will just be me, my brother, and our parents. I want you to come. It&#39;s a great opportunity to meet the family and I think it will just show you how serious I am about us.&#34;</p>
