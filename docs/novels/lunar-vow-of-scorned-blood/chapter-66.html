                <p>When we returned, Kariz was already waiting at us in the entrance. I glance at Galaz, did he snitch? He look guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to tell him. Because I have no other choice.&#34; He muttered, trying to defend himself. I didn&#39;t answered him and walk pass him. Kariz pull my arms when I reach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how dangerous it is to go back there.&#34; He mumbled, his grip was tighter than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to confirm something.&#34; I answered back and pulled my arms away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything and just let go of my arm. I went straight to my so called room and while I was on my way I bumped into Ria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had some fun with your stroll?&#34; She mumbled, I ignored her and she did what Kariz just done earlier. She yanked my arms back. But before she could even utter a word. I pinned her in the wall, she grunts upon the impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try to pissed me off or I will make sure you wouldn&#39;t be able to used you hands next time.&#34; I warned her before letting her fall. She started coughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah, someone is pissed.&#34; I heard Ali &#39;s words before I entered my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the door and let myself fall in the bed. I just stared at the ceiling the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering what I just witnessed earlier. I clenched my fist, just remembering it making me want to smack their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This damn emotions when I was Klaire is still here. I want to shake them off but everytime I saw him I can feel all my walls falling. Just like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way those green-blue eyes first approach me when I was alone in the shitty cage. He was the only one who showed me kindness that time yet he was also the one aho destroyed my everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2 years before they woke up I found out everything. That Belerick was the one who killed both my parents. He wanted me because I&#39;m the only one who could successfully turned into a Lycan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They continue torturing me that time after they finally saw some improvements from me. I can still feel the cold metal that they used in my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashback 2 years after Amara woke up in the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes, a blinding light welcome me. Am I dead? I smiled at that thought, thinking that finally I was able to be free but to my disappoinment Via&#39;s face showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you see me? Amara?&#34; Her voice sounded soft and worried. If only I didn&#39;t know her true intentions I will actually fall for her schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yes.&#34; I muttered, feeling my throat a bit sore. She gave me a glass of water as soon as she notice me having a hard time speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, drink it slowly.&#34; I was sure that it was a glass of water at first but then when I glance at it again it was nothing but blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widen when I realize I just drink that blood. The glass slip in my hands letting out a loud crash as it shattered on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong?&#34; She look surprised at my reaction. I hurriedly climbed out of the bed pulling out whatever wires that are connected in my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-why would you give me blood!&#34; I shouted when I reach the far corner of the room. She glance back at the glass then back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying? It was water. Look at it again.&#34; She mumbled, I continue to close my eyes refusing to see that red liquid again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering all my dreams while I was asleep made me more trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amara, it was not blood. Trust me it was water.&#34; She assured me. I open my eyes hesitantly and slowly glance back at where the glass feel. And just like what she said it was water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you are just shocked after sleeping for so long.&#34; She uttered. Then she instructed her people to start cleaning up the messed and bring me another class of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I refused her offer, I was afraid to see it turned into blood again. She watches me with hesitation but ended up agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, now I want you to rest for a while before I bring you your dinner.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything, wishing that she will leave me alone if I didn&#39;t answer and soon enough she finally decided to left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance around me and notice that I wasn&#39;t in the same white room before. It was still a room but this time the walls was obviously made of mirrors. I can&#39;t see the outside but I am sure someone is watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the blanket on me and decided to sleep again but once I did, I fully regret it after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes I was again in the dark room and just like before. When I took my first step I was transferred into a mountain top of dead bodies. I was standing right above them. And unlike before this time I could see their faces clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasp when I realize who they are. No! This can&#39;t be. This is all just a dream, it wasn&#39;t real!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I glance at my reflection from their eyes, I was completely covered with blood. But something is different, I don&#39;t look like myself. I was covered with this dark fur and my eyes were glowing like red rubies. And staring back at me is like a werewolf but was standing with only two feet. It was like a mixture of human and werewolf. And my hands. No! My claws are covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NOOOOOO!&#34; When I finally woke up. An alarm is sounded making me want to rip my ears because of the noise. I can hear footsteps running towards my direction. And when I&#39;m finally on my senses. My eyes widens, I stared at my little hands and they were covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell just happened? I glance at the door and it was shattered to pieces like someone just completely destroyed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Via came running towards me and when she notice the door her eyes widens. She look at me like I was some kind of freak. And for the first time I fear myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get those body out.&#34; She mumbled, I wanted to peak outside but I was too afraid to face my assumption. What if it was really my doings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally came back, she look like she was contemplating on what to say. And when she look like she finally decided what to do. She slowly walk towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, everything is complete fine.&#34; She uttered, but the way her forehead sweat is telling me otherwise. I can even hear his heart pounding really fast at the moment. When I finally notice what she was about to do. It was already too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled a syringe and before I could even react I was slowly losing conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you let this happened?&#34; I know it was Via&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We also aren&#39;t sure Ms. Via, this walls are made to make sure she wouldn&#39;t be able to used her abilities. We made sure of it.&#34; Someone answered, I wasn&#39;t sure who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just make sure this wouldn&#39;t happened again or else.&#34; That was the last thing I remember before I completely fell into a deep slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough I woke up into the familiar coldness, I was back again into a cold cell, but this time I was nowhere near from our old dungeon. It was damp and cold place. And when I tried to move a sharp object scratch my neck. It sting, I was chained. Both of my arms and legs plus the collar in my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally you are awake.&#34; I glance up to see a pair of gray eyes staring at me. He looks exactly like how I remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you in a while. And after what I heard last night I couldn&#39;t stop myself to come here and see you.&#34; His voice was full of excitement. i remember how excited I am to see him before but right now I don&#39;t feel anything but wanting to see his smash skull lying on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you aren&#39;t having a hard time with those things all over you. Soon enough we will transfer you into another place. After we are done knowing everything about your newly awaken abilities.&#34; He muttered when he notice my neck already bleeding from the scratch earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-why are you doing this?&#34; I couldn&#39;t help but ask, after everything I still want to have a little hope that I will be free after he was done with everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t answer that right now sweetheart. But just like what I said before once this are all finish you will be able to get out.&#34; I know part of me is felling me that he was lying but I couldn&#39;t think of anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are the others?&#34; I was finally able to ask for them. I wasn&#39;t sure what happened to them after I was take into the other room. I just hope they are all okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh don&#39;t worry, they are also just sleeping. Soon enough they will finally wake up. You will all be able to see each other.&#34; He answered. I felt my mood brighten up as I imagine all of us laying on the grass watching the clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you have to be a good girl. And do everything that we tell you to do. Because if not? You will never see your friends again.&#34; I couldn&#39;t stop myself to do nothing but nod my head. He smiled and pat my head. &#34;Good girl.&#34; He said, before he finally left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that I had no idea that I will start facing hell in their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started pulling out blood samples from me then after putting me into a large cage letting out some uncontrolled werewolves who lost their humanity for a long time. And they force me to kill them all in order to survive. I almost get myself killed that time but ended up killing them all. The following day they did the same thing. But it became more worse as time goes by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged myself, not wanting to remember what I just experience with those werewolves. Then again my worst nightmare came running towards me. The keys jingling, making me crawl towards the furthest part of the cell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh why are you looking at us like that. You know little girl you have to entertain us to make up from everything you have done to us. You know you are quite a pain in the ass.&#34; His words was full of malice. As he lick his lower lips. His eyes was staring at my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that they will kill us if we will do this.&#34; One of them mumbled, he look hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pussy! You think they wouldn&#39;t kill us after everything? Why not make everything out of it.&#34; The largest man mumbled. &#34;And beside she couldn&#39;t even do anything with all this chains. Did you forget what Carlos told us that night he tried? He just turned out to be a pussy and stop half way.&#34; He said, looking back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that the werewolf with him hold both my arms and legs. I tried to kick them and shout but no one came just like the other night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop moving around you little witch.&#34; He pulled his belt out and unzip his pants. I stared at them with complete horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noooo! Please!&#34; My voice sounded like a quiet cry. I cried and cried pleading them but they didn&#39;t listen. Why can&#39;t I used my abilities if I had any!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they are finally done I remained there quiet, laying on the cold ground. Wishing that I will finally die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See I told you.&#34; He uttered, this made completely enraged. I slowly lifted my naked body. They are still getting dressed so they didn&#39;t see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel my whole body feeling light, and before I know it I was devouring them. Ripping then to pieces. I can hear their shouts. They are muttering the word monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally regain my senses back I was completely covered with blood, with only some bones and flesh remains around me as well as their clothes rip into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the first time I smiled to myself as I saw the crimson color all over me.</p>
