                <p>I nodded and stood up. &#34;Bye&#34;, I said, but instead, she ran toward me and claimed my lips. I halted for a while trying to fight the desire that was burning me. This place might be quiet but anyone could see us. She bit my lips and just like that. I lost every will in me. I kiss her back, claiming her, owing her, making sure she never forgot me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We broke from the kiss panting heavily. &#34;I love you,&#34; she said, and once again, I felt a strange emotion in my tummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too,&#34; I said and watched as he made her way towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around and picked up my phone. Thankfully, no one was around, or so I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A clap from the side of the restaurant startled me. Goosebumps filled my skin. Someone saw us. Someone saw Luna kissing her ex-husband&#39;s brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to meet a slender talk man. Someone I could break easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would have thought that the new Luna has a lover? No wonder you booked the whole restaurant. Now I see&#34; he said with an amusing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoved his hands into his pocket and walked towards me &#34;Forgive me. Are you not Dean&#39;s brother? The weak rogue&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my wristwatch and looked around to make sure no one saw me murdering because I would kill him and leave no trace behind or maybe burn him to avoid every hybrid mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hit his hand on the table. &#34;I am sure I said something rogue,&#34; he said in a drained tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed &#34;Seriously? You were talking? Forgive me; I tend to zone out when fools are talking,&#34; I apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are rude for a rogue. Imagine what would happen if I told the Alpha that I saw his mate kissing a rogue. He would have your head for seeing her!&#34; He dared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes. This was why I did not want to kiss her back; this was why I just told her goodbye and left, even though everything within me wanted to take her and maybe fuck her against the table. She was no longer mine. It was a painful realization. She was Finn&#39;s mate and not mine. Not like she had ever been mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The toad moved towards me, keeping just an inch away from me. &#34;Imagine what he would do to you. The way he would kill you for laying your hands on his mate. I always knew something was wrong. She looked like a whore from afar&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it. That statement was what flipped my self-control and made anger rush towards me with the need to kill someone growing inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I burst into laughter, laughing at how unwise he was to do such a thing. To dare a hybrid. His face creased into a frown and my laughter increased. Seriously, I never knew people were this ugly.&#34;You seem to have so much faith in your Alpha&#34; I said, my face laced with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes. He is an Alpha and not a rogue&#34; he boasted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow. &#34;And well, I am not a rogue either,r,&#34; I disclosed and immediately launched toward him. I could feel my body changing, I could feel my wolf coming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened with fear. &#34;You are a .. Hybrid,&#34; he said and attempted to run, but it was already too late. I lunched towards him and snapped his neck before sucking his blood dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It tasted good and felt so good. The hunger increased in me. To take someone, to drink another blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way towards the bathroom and watched my mouth off the blood. I curled my fist even though I was trying so hard to control myself. Thank the moon goddess that we met on the outskirts of the town. Before someone would visit, it would take time; besides, the pack had already put a curfew, afraid of the blood-thirsty hybrid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out and poured the alcohol into his dead body before lighting it on fire. Without wasting time I exited through the back door and drove back to my pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the ride, my mind could not help but go back to Lia and the kiss and to how good blood felt. Even though I had tried to control myself I still found myself craving for more blood and more kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I knew what I was doing I was playing Lana del Rey music in my car. While imaging Lia&#39;s face that managed to calm me down. It surprised me how just the memory of her calmed my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I packed at a restaurant and called a guard to take the car home.  Then I followed a route that led to Benedicta&#39;s house. It was just seven, and everyone was afraid they had already locked themselves inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on Benedicta&#39;s door. She opened it after checking who I was through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My plan was to take my bath and sleep and then wait till the night when the hybrid came only for me to get there and see Sabrina sitting on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned as I cracked my neck. I was tired. &#34;Sabrina. What did you want?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled &#34;I came to see Merlin,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced around searching for the Merlin she came to see. &#34;It doesn&#39;t look like that because he is not here&#34; I retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile widened to a poker&#39;s own &#34;Manners, Luca. Manners. Where have you been?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smacked my lips and rolled my eyes. Seriously? Since when did I get an accountability partner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to see Merlin&#39;s mother,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, well while you were there. Jenny announced that you both are getting married, the day after tomorrow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? How? I mean.  Who did she tell?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged &#34;And Dean agreed. Do you know what that means?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, too tired to answer. &#34;It means that you now have official enemies. Especially with what happened this morning. People that want to see you fall&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0094</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you. Didn&#39;t I? I warned you that Luca wanted your throne but you refused. He wants lia and that is all! We would have killed him when we got the chance but you refused. Now, it is almost too late! He did not only talk back at you, he had managed to convince the people that you are a bad Alpha. Now they want him, Dean! They want a rogue over us, the Royal!&#34;Lorenzo shouted as he kicked the chair in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes for a while wondering who to believe between him and Luca. For me, Luca did not want the throne. It was evident in his face. You could see the surprise when they bowed to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was not my business. What I wanted to know was why he seemed so interested in checking that boy&#39;s body. It was as if he had a bond with him. Could he have kids I did not know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean! I am talking to you&#34; Lorenzo shouted again disrupting my thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as I used my fingers to massage my head. Sometimes, Lorenzo was a whole pack of trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am listening&#34; I replied even though I knew that he knew I was not listening but who cares. I am listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; He asked with so much anger in his voice, his eyes screaming revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whirled my chair around for a while before turning to him with a shrug. &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes &#34;What do you mean buy you don&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know what to do. You can&#39;t change people &#39;s minds in a whole day. They are not going to accept UA if the hybrid keeps attacking people. If we can kill the hybrid then we can talk to the people and convince them&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me with defeat before he finally sat down. His hands drummed the table &#34;How are we going to get him?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a question I could not answer. How will I be able to get him? He is a hybrid. My father had made sure he had killed all the hybrids after he discovered that a part of them was planning to overthrow him. Now he could not do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will keep on sending men till they kill him&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Is that the solution you have?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. What&#39;s he expecting? A genius idea? I had no idea how to kill a hybrid. Something within me told me that he wanted to take my throne. Maybe he will come back for revenge for what my father did to his kind and the only way to do that was to kill people. Making me look weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know the bond between that child and Luca?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow &#34;How does that relate to what we are talking about?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took shaky breaths and sighs. I sighed and saw this same boy with the same bracelet on his hands and he was calling me father. At first, I thought it was a mere dream until it started repeating itself again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. He seemed so attached to the body&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo nodded and took a sip of his drink. &#34;That does not matter now that the boy is dead. The parents came to take him away&#34; he informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a final gulf of drink and sat up looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do, Luca might become the Alpha&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will not&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hissed in annoyance. This man had a way of getting on my nerves. He had always wanted us to kill Luca one way or the other. Fond silly excuse to make sure we  killed him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can kill him accusing him of treason&#34; he suggested with an amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile back,not at him but at his foolishness. Like what would someone decide to be this annoying? I have told him times without number that killing Luca was out of the picture. Is it either we lock him, stab him, punish him or not kill him? Like it or not he is the only cousin I had. My only family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Well he has not committed treason&#34; I defended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Did you not see the way he talked back to you? He wanted you to appear weak that is enough treason&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. If we start killing people because they talked back at me everyone around me would have been dead&#34; I said with a sarcastic tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He opened his mouth to talk,&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened. It was as if he was trying to digest whatever I said. Trying to wrap it around his head that I had just told him he was living at my mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am your Beta, Dean. Your best friend. You would cut me some slack&#34; he said in a weak terrified voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled &#34;I know, you are my Beta. But you and I know that you were Luca&#39;s Best friend, not mine. You left him after what he did so don&#39;t come here telling me what to do, Who to punish and who not to punish. You and I both know that you would switch sides if anything happened to me. So do something for me. Find out who that dead boy is to Luca and find a witch that can help us locate the hybrid &#34;I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me in disbelief. Then he shoved his hands into his pocket. &#34; If this is what I get for my loyalty. Then okay. I would go and find a way to kill the hybrid while you sit here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and waved my hands at him. Dismissing him. I was already too tired to argue with him. He knows I told him the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone seeped with a notification. I clicked on it. It was a message from Jenny</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have told the people. I and Luca are getting married&#34; she informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0095</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I stepped out of the restaurant. Cold caressed my skin causing goosebumps to cloak my skin. I hugged myself tightly. I stopped for a while to stare at Luca&#39;s car. That car had brought me so many memories. I had cried in that car, had multiple orgasms, and even quarreled in that same car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting much more time I went away. Making sure no one saw me, I wrapped my scarf carefully to avoid suspicion. My mouth still smells like scotch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment I wondered what would have happened if Luca just took me to the table there without wasting time or trying to restrain himself. I could tell that he wanted to fuck me hard from the way he looked at me with desire mixed with lust or with the way he caressed my lips after the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, I stopped at the center of the pack and took a cab to the palace. I wonder why Finn started looking for me. Like he had Binaca he should try to focus on her and leave me alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the gate opened, and I stepped outside. Annabel rushed to me with worry masked on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Annabel, what happened? You don&#39;t look okay&#34; I said with a hint of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha has been looking for you. He is so furious right now&#34; she informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes &#34;Is that the reason for your fear? I will be fine&#34; I assured her, squeezing her shoulders lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded with a plastered smile. &#34;I know. It&#39;s just that he has anger issues, and he felt you were in danger,&#34; she said, taking my handbag from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, heaving a sigh of relief. It was better than him thinking I had gone to see Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any free clothes?&#34; I asked if I needed to cover Luca: &#39;s scent around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Where is he?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the pool. Alone&#34; she added with emphasis on alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the least of my concerns right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get me some of your clothes. I need to change&#34; I informed her. She stared at me with wide eyes, I knew so many questions were running through her mind. Like, what did a royalty need maid clothes for or stuff like that, but it was not my business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you waiting for? Get going,&#34; I ordered, dismissing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded with hesitation and ran away. I immediately rushed into my room and took my bath, trying to scrub off Luca&#39;s scent on me, but no matter how I did it. I could not erase his presence from my mind. His smile still caused butterflies to fill my tummy and even the imagery of his husky voice warmed my ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought the clothes and I put them on. I allowed it to stay on my Body for a while before I changed into my actual royal clothes and made my way to the pool. He seemed to have a swimming</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully by the time I got there, no one was there. It was just me and him and his house guard. Immediately he saw me he swamped outside, worry masked his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where have you been? I have been searching for you&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a polite smile. My body reacted to his touch but my heart did not. When I looked at his eyes, my stomach did not flutter, and I did not find it hard to breathe with his piercing gaze. Everything was ordinary without any emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I not get mated to Luca? It would have been an epic love story but then again, I could not be mated to him. He had a mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat &#34;I went to visit Benedicta and Lexie. Lexie was slightly injured. We needed to take care of her&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heaved a sigh of relief. &#34;Yes, I know, but you would have told me. I could have sent some guards with you. What if they had hurt you?&#34; He asked with genuine concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It touched my heart. It seriously did but it was not needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are my pack members. They would never hurt me&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;Yes, but that was before, but now you are the Luna of another pack. Not just another pack but an enemy who tooked their Luna,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever he said was true. I knew that most of the pack females would hate me because I was Finn&#39;s mate but I didn&#39;t think they would hurt me. Luca would not let them touch my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go back to our room,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and walked in total silence. It was only filled with stolen glances from Finn. My mind wandered around so many things like what would I do if he caught me. What excuse was I going to give tomorrow to make him allow me to visit Merlin? Did anyone see me with Luca?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you not tell me you were going?&#34; He asked again for the second time. Irritation was already building up within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; you and your secretary. Oh, sorry you and your cousin went to a business meeting. How was I meant to see you?&#34; I asked, my tone lacking impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me from the side and tilted his head to the other side. &#34;Nothing is going on Lia. I don&#39;t know what I would do to convince you&#34; he said softly, as if he was imploring me to trust him to give him a little piece of my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you say so,&#34; I said and continued walking in utter silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we entered the room I pulled my Royal gown and changed to a more suitable outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I came outside, there was a card on the table with Finn leaning on the wall beside it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; I asked to open the invitation card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An invitation to Luca&#39;s marriage&#34; he informed me. Although he tried to sound normal, I could feel the hint of joy in his tone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0096</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, well while you were there. Jenny announced that you both are getting married, the day after tomorrow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? How? I mean.  Who did she tell?&#34; I asked anger mixed with disbelief welled up within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell is wrong with Jenny? How would you announce a marriage when the groom clearly disagrees where this is done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Dean agreed. It means you now have so many enemies&#34; Sabrina informed me with delight in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not blame her. She lived for the delight of war, chaos, and anything that would add importance to her presence in the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced around the room as I tried to wrap my head around what was happening. How the hell did Dean agree to this? Marriage was the last thing on my mind right now. I would never get married to her. I would never become Jenny&#39;s husband. She knew I had commitment issues. I sometimes like to taste a different flavour that was why we organised threesomes or a sex party. The only time my sexual desires to one person was when I was with Lia. I still find myself masturbating with just the thought of her in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was just a rumour Sabrina was trying to pull my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how did  you hear about this information?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta stood up and gave me an invitation letter with my name and hers in it. Frustration filled up within me. I raked my hand on my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many people did she share this with? Is it only an important member of the pack?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can&#39;t just print cards within a day that would curtail the whole pack. We were much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The whole pack and even the royals in another pack</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief washed through me. What the hell! What the actual fuck! How the hell did this happen? To all the royals of other packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To all Royal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To all Royal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened with disbelief. It only meant that she must have asked them to give Finn. Lia must have seen the card. She must have seen the wedding card. Now she would think I was just trying to play with her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the fuck would she feel. I fucking kissed her and now I am getting married. She would feel used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That means Lia must have found out about us,&#34; I said, rather than a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina nodded &#34;She and Dean played a fast game&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;A fast one&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are the people taking it?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. Some are happy about it. Others are angry. They feel you should have waited for a while before getting married to her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. I took a glance at Benedicta and Sabrina. &#34;Where is Merlin?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is asleep. He slept early&#34; she said before asking &#34;What did Lia say&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart squeezed at how Lia would react if she found out about this. She was even coming tomorrow. I would have to visit tomorrow. Make her understand me. I would never wed Jenny. Not even at death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She will be coming tomorrow,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around and walked towards the door but Sabrina grabbed my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked shooting a death glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled. &#34;Firstly, remove that glare. I am not the reason you are getting married and secondly, what do you plan on doing when you get there?&#34; She asked with a serious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I relaxed a bit trying to hide my frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step backward and stared at her. &#34;I would make sure she revokes the plan and then asks Dean to cancel the marriage. I am not getting married to Jenny and I won&#39;t!&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped her lips. &#34;Is that your lame idea?&#34; She asked with a daring tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes &#34;Look, Sabrina. I am tired and I am not up for any game or scheming. So tell me what is on your mind and let me go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained silent, staring at me. Seriously speaking, if she was a younger girl and not my mother&#39;s best friend. I would have mistaken her affection and stare for love.</p>

                <p>&#34;Do you think Jenny printed those cards in just one or two days? Did she plan it down? Does she know what she is doing? She doesn&#39;t want you or Dean. She wants the throne. I can see it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her; she had told me the same words that Lia had told me.</p>
