                <p>Allison waking up both startled Lena and I, but filled us with relief. I was so thankful she was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back and forth between us before saying,&#34;You&#39;ll never believe what just happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, what happened?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I visited Selene, the moon goddess in my dream. I have good news and bad news, what do you want to hear first?&#34; She said/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I guess rip the bandaid off on the bad news.&#34; I sighed, kind of worried for what the bad news may be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The first part of the bad news, is my sweet Aspen is no longer my wolf. She sacrificed herself to get us out of that cell, it was too much for us both and the moon goddess gave her a choice, she chose to save me and have her own life taken. But I got to see her and she is with Selene now, she is safe.&#34; She looked sad at the loss of her wolf, did this mean she was wolfless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what you are thinking, I must be wolfless. But Selene gifted me a new wolf. A powerful one, that will help me to fulfill the prophecy. Her name is Eve. There&#39;s something else that Selene told me, you might not like...&#34; She said while looking at me, then looking at her hands before continuing,&#34;I will still have a mate bond with you Damon, even with Aspen being gone. But with Eve being my new wolf. There is the possibility that I will have a second mate. Selene said I can hold the mate bond with both mates, or reject one mate and stay with the other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hold in the growl that escaped me. I felt furious even thinking about another man touching or being around my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another mate?!&#34; I roared. I knew it was unfair of me, this should be Allison&#39;s choice. But the thought of sharing her made me sick. This is my woman, my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Damon, I didn&#39;t mean to upset you with this. I just wanted to be honest with you about what is to come. I will always love you, and I can say for sure that I will never reject you. Now,&#34; She said, turning to look at Lena.&#34; You must be my grandmother. I&#39;m so glad you are okay. I see where mom and I got our eye color from now. It is so nice to finally meet you Grandma&#34;, Allison had tears in her eyes as she said as she opened her arms to Lena for a hug. The mate situation could wait, this moment between them was special. Lena was her last living family member. They both needed this. Lena quickly wiped the tears that had started streaming down her face. I can only imagine how important it was to her to have Allison call her grandma. She then embraced Allison with a hug. Both cried silently, in each others arms. It was a beautiful moment. I stood up, and Lena noticed, so she opened her eyes to look at me, silently questioning where I was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You two have lots of catching up to do. I am going to give you some privacy. I said into mind link</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, get over here Damon.&#34; She said outloud while stretching one of her arms out for me to join the hug. I hesitated, wanting to let them have their moment. But I realized, other than the short time in the cell with Allison, I have not shared any physical contact with anyone in 3 years. I needed this hug. So I wrapped my arms around both of them. I felt a tear threatening to escape at this loving embrace, but held it in. I am so damn lucky to have such amazing people in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, let&#39;s get the doctor to give you one last checkup and then let&#39;s get you home. Lena, I have a surprise for you.&#34; I had something planned for her, that I think she would like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor had given Allison the go ahead to leave, so with that the three of us headed towards the packhouse. Upon arriving at the packhouse, Chad was the only person in there. I had asked him to clear everyone out so that it wouldn&#39;t be so overwhelming for Allison and Lena. The pack can welcome them another time after they are settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, it&#39;s exactly the way I remember it&#34; Allison said in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had everything rebuilt exactly the same. Your room was the only one that survived the fire for some reason, so they basically built the whole house around it.&#34; I said as I held the large oak door open for her and Lena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s so good to see you, Allison.&#34; Chad said as he pulled her in for a hug. She hugged him back, confusion and relief covering her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chad, I thought you were dead, thank god you are alright!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon can fill you in on everything. Glad to see you back, everything you asked for me to get together is in the Alpha and Luna room, Alpha.&#34; He chuckled as he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Chad.&#34; I said,&#34;Allison, all of your things are in your room if you want to change out of the hospital gown. I&#39;ll be right up there, Lena? Would you mind following me? I have something to show you.&#34; Allison nodded and continued up the stairs to her room. Lena and I followed her, but instead of going in with her, walked past her room, to what is the designated Alpha and Luna room, though it hasn&#39;t been touched since the house was rebuilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this about Damon?&#34; Lena asked as she entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost everything was destroyed in the packhouse fire. But along with Allison&#39;s room, there were some other things that didn&#39;t get destroyed. You can sleep in this room as long as you would like, move into it if you want, or if you would be more comfortable, I can arrange for a house for you close-by.&#34; I said as I pointed to the things that were scattered over the bed. It was photo albums of Luna Rachel growing up, as well as Allison growing up. There were report cards from both, crafts that they made in school. There were some vhs tapes of Rachel learning to sit, crawl, walk and even her first words. There were some Dvd&#39;s of all of Allisons firsts too. Things that Lena didn&#39;t get to be there for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed to the TV at the foot of the bed, &#34;Chad had already set up the joint vhs/dvd player. This was all kept in the basement, that&#39;s why it survived the fire. It&#39;s everything you have missed. I want you to have it all. You made a hard decision to give up Rachel, I can see the regret in your eyes. But I see it as brave. You were brave enough to know that you weren&#39;t in the right mind to care for a child. You were brave enough to give her to a family that would love her dearly the way you wanted to but couldn&#39;t at the time. You are so brave, Lena. I&#39;ll leave you to it, like I said, you can take all the time you need, even move in here.&#34; I genuinely meant every word. I respected Lena, she was a strong woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Damon, I guess there is more to you than just muscle and no brains,&#34; she chuckled while wiping her tears away,&#34;Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. Now go see Allison. I&#39;m going to watch all of these videos and bawl my eyes out for the next few hours.&#34; She shooed me out as she said this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way to Allison&#39;s room. She was already under the blankets. What a sight she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before you come over here, can I ask you something?&#34; She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you ever...sleep with anyone else while I was gone?&#34; She looked down at the blanket, as if afraid of my answer. But with no hesitation, I told her the truth,&#34;No, I knew from a young age that we were mates. I have never touched or even thought about touching anyone else aside from you. I slept in your room while you were gone. I was in a dark place then. I was nobody without you.&#34; I felt vulnerable admitting this, but I knew I could trust her with these feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled,&#34;I can smell you all over the room, I love it. Get over here, then come cuddle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately removed my boots and climbed into bed. On lifting the covers I found a surprise.&#34;Allison, you&#39;re naked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, now are you going to join me?&#34; Holf f*ck. This woman, gone, was my sweet Allison. This woman before me held confidence and it was doing things to me. I stripped off of my clothes, naked as the day I was born, and jumped into bed next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at me with those gorgeous green eyes of hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you Damon.&#34; She said while she ran her delicate fingers up my abs, tracing each one, sparks running through my body with every touch. She then traced the A and the green eyes I had tattooed on my chest, it was my way of always having her with me, even when she was missing. She then traced her finger up my neck and then to my lips. I was rock-hard just from her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; I asked, not wanting to push her to do something she wasn&#39;t ready to do, I wanted everything to be at her pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never been more sure in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me if you want me to stop, everything is at your pace, Allison. I&#39;ll never force you into anything.&#34; I genuinely meant it. Anything for my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damon, I want you dammit.&#34; She stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Say no more, I flipped my body on top of hers, supporting my weight on one arm, while the other caressed her stomach and around her breasts. I found a nipple and pinched it, a moan escaped her, my hand continued massaging her breasts and playing with her nipples. I brought my lips down to meet hers. The kiss was slow and passionate, until our mouths parted and our tongues started dancing with each other. The kiss turned hungry, her hands running through my hair. I nibbled her lip and she gently bit mine. I then started kissing across her face, nibbling her earlobe, then working my way to her neck, kissing each spot, savoring her. I sucked gently on the spot where my mark would be, she moaned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed farther down, sucking on one nipple while I played with the other. I kissed down her stomach, leaving hickies and small bites everywhere I touched. I let a claw extend and gently traced her thigh with it, making my way up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth found her clit, at first kissing it, teasing her and taking my time. Her hands found my hair and massaged my scalp. I got to work licking her slowly at first, then picking up the pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was licking and sucking her p*ssy. I brought my finger to my lips and licked it, I then slowly slid it into her. F*ck she was tight. I could feel her clenching and unclenching around my finger. I pushed it in and out of her slowly. I then curled it up ever so slightly and started pumping it, finding a rythym, I started to lick again. She was moaning, the sounds getting louder as her climax was building. I quickened my pace, pumping in and out of her, licking her faster, my tongue changing from up and down to figure 8&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her thighs around my head, her grip on my hair tightened, she screamed as she came, juices spraying out at me. Her whole body vibrated with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I licked up the juices and crawled up her body. I kissed her so she could taste herself on me. I waited for her to confirm she was ready, but she grabbed my cock and lined it up with her entrance. Our eyes met, not breaking eye contact, I slowly slid my cock in, watching her for any sign of pain so I could stop, she placed her hands on my back and wrapped her legs around my waist. I pushed myself until it was all of the way in. I stayed still to let her adjust to the size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck me Damon.&#34; She moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started off slowly, pumping my thick cock into her. F*ck she was tight. I picked up speed, thrusting hungrily into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of skin slapping and moaning filled the room. Tears of pleasure sprung from her eyes as they rolled back into her head. I could feel myself getting close, I could feel her p*ssy gripping my cock as she reached her climax, she pulled my neck down to her mouth and I felt her fangs, she bit down and all over her feelings of pleasure rushed into my body as she marked me. I roared her name, I couldn&#39;t hold it any longer, I coated her insides with my cum as I extended my fangs and marked her neck. She screamed my name as she came. My feelings of pleasure rushed into her as we became one, marked and mated. I pulled out of her and watched in satisfaction as my cum spilled out of her. I lay on the bed next to her, both of us out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you so much Allison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you Damon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, we curled into each other&#39;s arms and fell asleep.   A:N/ Hello lovely readers, what do you think? Do you want this scene from Allison&#39;s POV? Hope you are enjoying so far!

                <p>Happy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allison POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon waking up at the hospital, I explained everything to Damon and my grandmother. I knew it would be hard for Damon to hear about me having another potential mate, but I knew that I needed to be honest with him about it. I had absolutely no plans of ever rejecting Damon. He is the man of my dreams. For the three years I was gone, he never lost hope, never gave up on me. So I knew that I would never give up on him, on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then went on to talk with my grandmother. She had the same green eyes that my mother and I have. There was no mistaking the similarities between us either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed her hug, to feel that familiar embrace of family, because in reality she was the only family I had left. I let the tears flow as we hugged each other, she then insisted that Damon join us. I think he needed this hug just as much as we did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor gave me the all clear to head out, so we decided to go back to the pack house and call it a night. It was a long day. Hell, it&#39;s been a long three years. I was still devastated about Aspen&#39;s sacrifice, it was so incredibly brave of her. She was such a loyal wolf, and she will always hold a piece of my heart with her. It brings me peace knowing that she is safe and happy with Selene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked when I saw the pack house, It was exactly the way I remember it. As if the fire never happened. Damon explained that he had it rebuilt to be the exact same. I found it odd that my room was left untouched by the fire. Upon entering the pack house I saw Chad. I felt confused but also a huge wave of relief. I don&#39;t know how, but somehow he was alive. Thank the goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon told me to go head up to my room for a change of clothes. He had a surprise for Grandma. I was curious what it was but didn&#39;t question it further. I&#39;m sure he would tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered my room and heard Damon and Grandma walk towards the Alpha and Luna room, what used to be mom and dad&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could over-hear their conversation with my wolf hearing. I realized what Damon had done for grandma. He had everything put together of all of the memories from mom and I as babies, and us as we grew up. I was touched by his thoughtfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I undressed out of the hospital gown and jumped into the shower. Everything of mine was just the way I left it. The only difference was Damon&#39;s delicious scent all over my room. It was mouth watering. I quickly scrubbed my body and washed my hair, I then exited the shower and was about to find a change of clothes when Eve started talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mate him, it will help you both to become stronger together and separately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you sure about this Eve? I&#39;ve never done anything before. The most I did was kiss him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trust me, your mate respects you, he will guide you through it. He loves you, and us him. It will help you both become one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, if you say so. The moon goddess said I have a lot to learn about you. Can you tell me some things about yourself, Eve?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am the very first wolf to have ever existed. I have lived many lives. I am the moon goddess&#39;s first creation. You will learn more soon. Our mate is coming back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped under the covers, naked. Something about Eve made me full of confidence. Damon walked into the room, his scent hitting me instantly. He was a handsome man. He was somehow the kindest man on earth, but carried such a bloodthirsty look to him, like he would snap your neck in a split second. His body was full of rippling muscles that flexed with every movement. His tattoos that covered his arms and up his neck just added to his bad boy look. His dirty blonde hair that looked perfectly messy, and his chiseled face holding a grin that showed off his perfect dimples, his damn lips. Oh so kissable, and those eyes, I could get lost in those perfect hazel eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it was selfish to ask him if he had been with another woman in my absence, but I couldn&#39;t stop myself. His answer, however, confirmed that tonight would be the night I gave him my virginity. He cherished me, he loved me. He was so raw and vulnerable with his feelings, I respected that about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want him in this bed with me now. I needed him inside of me. I had no idea what to do, but I had this new wave of confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I traced my finger up his now naked body, tracing every rivet in his abs, sparks spreading through my body, I traced the A and the wolf eyes he had tattooed. Every time I played eyes on it I got butterflies. I traced his neck, and then ran my finger across his perfect full lips. I loved the respect he had for me. I knew he wouldn&#39;t push me into doing something I wasn&#39;t ready for, but damn, it just made me want him more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put his large muscled body on top of my small figure, he caressed my stomach in a slow, teasing manner, then around my breasts, they immediately reacted to his touch, my nipples hard and my core getting wet with anticipation. He pinched my nipple causing me to moan, he played and massaged my breasts before bringing me in for a kiss full of love and passion, our lips meeting together, our lips parted for one another and our tongues danced in each other&#39;s mouths. It made me want more, so much more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel him growing hard in between my legs, it was huge. So huge, I could feel my confidence wavering as I felt it grow. Was the man part horse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my hands through his hair, the hair that I&#39;d been longing to play with. He nibbled my lip and I gently bit his back. He then kissed along my face towards my ear, gently nibbling it before moving down. He sucked on the spot where his mark would be, it caused butterflies to rush through my stomach as I moaned and I could feel my p*ssy clenching, wanting him inside of me just from that little suckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed down my body further, stopping to play and suck on my nipples. He moved on to my stomach, leaving small hickeys and bite marks with every kiss. His claw extended and traced up my thigh, it made a shiver run through my body, I wanted more of him and he was teasing me, making my body feel things I never thought I would feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth then latched on my clit, kissing it at first. The feeling was sensational, he then licked it and sucked it, I instantly grabbed his hair, massaging his scalp, encouraging him to continue, not wanting this moment to end. I watched as he brought his finger to his lips and sucked it for a brief moment, he then slowly pushed it into me. I immediately clenched around it, it felt amazing. I could feel him curl his finger up and a knot formed low in my belly. He then pumped his finger while he continued licking me, the pumping of his finger got faster, while his licking sped up. I could feel his tongue doing different patterns on my clit. My moans got louder and louder and my grip on his hair tightened as I wrapped my thighs around his head. I could feel something building up within me, until a scream of pleasure left my body. I could feel myself spraying him and my body shook with satisfaction, he licked up the remaining juices and crawled up my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me and I could taste myself on him. I wanted to pleasure him now, I knew he was waiting for me to give him permission, so I took his huge c*ck into my hand and lined it up with my entrance. Our eyes met, hazel on green. He patiently slid himself into me. A sharp pain coursed through me as he entered, but I didn&#39;t let it show, I didn&#39;t want this moment to end. I placed my hands on his back, nails digging in ever so slightly, and wrapped my legs around his waist. He pushed himself until it was all of the way in. It hurt a lot at first, but he waited until I adjusted. The pain turned into a pleasurable feeling and I knew I wanted to keep going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned as I told him to f*ck me, and he did. Slowly at first, but I could see the hunger in his eyes. He needed more, he picked up the pace and thrusted inside of me hard and fast. His thick c*ck stretching my p*ssy out, I couldn&#39;t help the moans that left me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears of pleasure left my eyes as they rolled into the back of my head. I could feel myself getting so close again. My p*ssy clenching and unclenching around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mark him. Eve said into my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed Damon&#39;s neck and let my fangs come out. I bit down, marking what is mine. My feelings rushing into him. I licked the mark just as he roared my name, I could feel his d*ck throbbing inside of me as he released his load, covering my insides with his seed. He marked me next, pushing me to scream his name as I came around his c*ck, his feelings rushing into me. We were marked and mated. Two people joined as one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as he pulled out of me, my body already missing the feeling of him inside of us. I could feel his c*m dripping out of me and he watched it with a satisfied gaze. I felt heat pooling in my lower stomach at this look. Wanting to take him all over again, but knowing my body would need time to heal after him being inside of me for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lay next to me, both of us out of breath. I felt so incredibly happy. Just when I thought the moment couldn&#39;t be anymore perfect, he told me he loved me. I, of course, returned it. I truly did love Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His scent wrapped around me as we curled into each other&#39;s arms. I felt safe with him. Sleep took me away soon after.</p>
