                <p>The link cut, and Sophia exhaled, her fingers flying over the console as she integrated the surface data with Aquaria&#39;s archives. The patterns began to coalesce, making a trail that led her heart sank.</p>

                <p>The council met in chaos. The revelation of the Leviathan&#39;s impending attack sent shockwaves through the chamber. Traditionalists denounced the use of surfaceworld technology, their voices rising in anger.</p>

                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Tharros&#39; voice boomed, silencing the room. His golden eyes burned with power. &#34;Sophia&#39;s methods may be unconventional, but they have saved us before. We will not let bias blind us now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stepped forward, his spear hitting the ground for emphasis. &#34;If the Leviathan is coming, we need every advantage we can get. We&#39;re out of time for debates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s voice cut through like a blade. &#34;And if we fail, there won&#39;t be a council left to argue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood at the middle, feeling the weight of their gazes. &#34;We can prepare. We know its pattern. We know its goal. But we need to act now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded. &#34;Then let us begin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city became a hive of activity. Soldiers armed themselves, magical barriers were strengthened, and Sophia worked tirelessly to finetune the defense plan. Her heart raced as she coordinated with both surface satellites and Aquarian magic, closing the gap between two worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hours ticked by, a sense of foreboding fell over her. Tharros found her at the edge of the city, looking into the dark expanse of the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re carrying too much,&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at him, her eyes tired but determined. &#34;I have to. If we fail&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t.&#34; His speech was firm, his presence grounding. &#34;You&#39;re not alone in this, Sophia. Remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed a faint smile. &#34;I&#39;ll try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attack came at dawn. The waters darkened as the Leviathan&#39;s shadow rose over the city. Its roar shattered the silence, a sound that reverberated through bone and stone alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fight was chaos. Soldiers fought with corrupted creatures, their weapons glowing with enchantments. Arin&#39;s magic crackled in the air, weaving through the fray like a live thing. Kael led the charge, his spear a blur of deadly accuracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia worked from the command center, her hands flying over the controls as she directed energy pulses and planned defenses. But her heart sank as she watched the Leviathan press closer, its massive form shrugging off their charges like gnats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too strong,&#34; she whispered, fear creeping into her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Tharros said, his voice steady beside her. &#34;We&#39;re stronger. Together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put a hand on her shoulder, and she felt the surge of his power flow into her. It was raw, overwhelming, but she channeled it, her own energy rising to meet his. The console flared to life, its lights blazing as the city&#39;s defenses roared back to full power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the Leviathan faltered, its moves slowing as the combined might of Aquaria pushed it back. But just as hope began to bloom, the creature&#39;s eyes burned brighter, its body shifting with a new, scary energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart stopped as the monitors blared a single word: &#34;Eruption.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan let out a final, deafening roar, and the ocean floor beneath Aquaria started to tremble. Sophia&#39;s blood ran cold as she realized the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not just attacking,&#34; she whispered. &#34;It&#39;s waking something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fractured Trust</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tremors beneath Aquaria grew stronger, the very seabed quivering with a force that seemed to echo the Leviathan&#39;s rage. Sophia stood frozen in the command center, her mind running. The word &#34;eruption&#34; still blinked eerily on the console. She turned to Tharros, her words urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to evacuate the outer districts. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, his golden eyes stiffening. &#34;Kael, take the guard. Arin, seal the barrier spells.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s jaw clenched, but he didn&#39;t pause. &#34;On it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin cast a glance at Sophia, a flicker of worry breaking through her usual composure. &#34;Be careful,&#34; she said before fleeing into the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt Tharros&#39; steady presence beside her. &#34;What are we missing?&#34; he asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers tightened on the console. &#34;This isn&#39;t just a physical attack. The Leviathan is spreading fear and division. If it succeeds, we&#39;ll kill ourselves from within.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the first refugees were led into the central dome, rumors had already spread. Whispers of sabotage, of betrayal within the palace, ran through the crowd like a dangerous current. Sophia caught snippets as she moved through the hallways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They knew where to strike&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone&#39;s feeding it information&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How else could it breach the barriers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart sank. Mistrust was a poison that could weaken them faster than any monster. She found Kael in the armory, his expression dark as he gave orders to his warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael,&#34; she called, drawing him away. &#34;We need to address this now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed. &#34;You think I&#39;m not trying? My men are scared. If there&#39;s a spy, they don&#39;t know who to trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need proof,&#34; Sophia said strongly. &#34;Accusations will tear us apart. If the Leviathan has someone on the inside, we have to find them before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s jaw tensed. &#34;And if we can&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s voice relaxed. &#34;We will. We have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The palace felt colder than usual that night. Sophia couldn&#39;t shake the sense of being watched as she worked in her lab, studying the latest readings. The Leviathan&#39;s energy signature was erratic, as if it were feeding off the chaos in Aquaria. Her thoughts were interrupted by a faint knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; she said without looking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin slipped inside, her face unreadable. &#34;You look like you haven&#39;t slept in days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t,&#34; Sophia revealed. &#34;But neither has anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin leaned against the wall, her dark aura pulsing slightly. &#34;You think this spy is real, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia paused. &#34;I don&#39;t want to believe it. But the Leviathan has been one step ahead of us. That can&#39;t be a coincidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;And what happens when you find them? What if it&#39;s someone close to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s chest tightened. &#34;I don&#39;t know. But we can&#39;t let it break us. Unity is our only chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded slowly. &#34;Then you&#39;d better find them fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, chaos erupted in the council room. An explosion in the eastern district had left dozens wounded, the shimmering barriers compromised. Tharros stood at the head of the table, his presence dominant but tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was no accident,&#34; he said, his voice cold. &#34;Someone here is working against us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room exploded in angry voices. Accusations flew, each council member casting suspicious looks at their peers. Sophia felt the tension building like a storm about to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; she yelled, her voice cutting through the noise. &#34;Fighting each other won&#39;t solve this. We need to focus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One adult glared at her. &#34;Easy for you to say. You&#39;re the outsider here. How do we know you&#39;re not the traitor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart pounded, but she stood her ground. &#34;Because I&#39;ve been risking my life to protect this city. I&#39;ve fought beside you. If we keep tearing each other apart, we&#39;re doing the Leviathan&#39;s work for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros raised a hand, quiet the room. &#34;Sophia is right. We cannot let fear dictate our deeds. But we must find the spy. And we will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Sophia joined Kael and Arin in the war room. The air between them was tense, the weight of suspicion weighing heavily on all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been going over the security feeds,&#34; Sophia said, her voice steady. &#34;There&#39;s a gap in the footage from the eastern district-right before the explosion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;A deliberate wipe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most likely,&#34; Sophia stated. &#34;Whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin crossed her arms. &#34;So we&#39;re looking for someone with access to the palace&#39;s security systems. That narrows it down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s eyes flicked to Arin. &#34;Or someone with magic strong enough to bypass them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charge hung in the air, unspoken but heavy. Arin&#39;s eyes flashed, her words dangerously calm. &#34;Careful, Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped between them, her voice strong. &#34;Stop. This is exactly what the Leviathan wants. We&#39;re stronger together, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael looked away, his jaw tight. Arin&#39;s face softened, though her eyes still glinted with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Kael grumbled. &#34;What&#39;s our next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia breathed. &#34;We set a trap. Let&#39;s see if the spy takes the bait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan was simple but risky. Sophia shared false information about a critical weakness in Aquaria&#39;s defenses, ensuring it reached the ears of every council member. Then they waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed with painful slowness. Sophia paced the command center, her nerves frayed. Tharros stood close, his presence a steadying force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll take the bait,&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if they don&#39;t?&#34; Sophia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will,&#34; he repeated, his golden eyes steadfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the alarm sounded. A transmission had been intercepted, the false information passed to an unknown source. Sophia&#39;s heart raced as she followed the signal&#39;s trail, her hands flying over the panel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; she said. &#34;The message was sent from inside the palace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; eyes darkened. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia paused, her stomach twisting. The numbers didn&#39;t lie. She turned the screen to face him, her voice heavy with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was one of the council members.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogue was brought before the council that night. The elder&#39;s face was pale, their eyes darting nervously as the charges were read aloud. Sophia watched the room, noting the mixture of anger, betrayal, and fear on every face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Tharros demanded, his words cutting through the tense silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elder shook. &#34;I thought I thought I could deal with it. Save myself. Save my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You endangered everyone,&#34; Kael snarled, his hands clenched. &#34;Your cowardice could have destroyed us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s voice was softer, but no less strong. &#34;The Leviathan doesn&#39;t make bargains. It consumes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elder broke down, crying. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean for it to go this far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stepped forward, his face cold. &#34;You have betrayed Aquaria. There will be consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elder was taken away, leaving the room in heavy quiet. Sophia turned to the group, her voice steady despite the chaos in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t let this divide us,&#34; she said. &#34;If we do, the Leviathan wins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, his eyes meeting hers. &#34;Unity is our greatest weapon. We must hold fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, as Sophia sat alone in her quarters, a chilling thought struck her. The intercepted message had been too easy to follow, the trail too clean. She replayed the data, her heart sinking as she spotted the oddity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This wasn&#39;t just a spy,&#34; she whispered. &#34;It was a distraction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden roar rang through the city, the sound of barriers shattering. Sophia&#39;s blood ran cold as she rushed to the window, her breath stopping at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan had returned, and this time, it wasn&#39;t alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Prophecy Interpreted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s roars could be heard all over Aquaria, and its shadowy shape looked bigger than ever. Sophia ran through the palace rooms, her heart beating so fast that she could hear it. The ground was shaking with the same speed as her heart. The walls around the city flickered, and their glowing shields broke under the huge attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin stood in the old library. Her dark magic made the walls look creepy with shadows. She hunched over a broken tablet that had strange symbols written on it and gave off a faint glow when she touched it. As Sophia rushed in, gasping for air, the faint hum of old magic got stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia called out, &#34;Arin.&#34; Her voice was rough. &#34;What did you find?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf didn&#39;t look up. Her eyes were locked on the swirling writing, her fingers tracing the lines with urgency. Her voice was low but firm as she said, &#34;It&#39;s the prophecy.&#34; &#34;The one the Whale Song Seers spoke of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped closer, the weight of the words pushing on her chest. &#34;What does it say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s jaw clenched, her normal sharpness replaced by a rare flicker of hesitation. &#34;It speaks of a bridge, a bond between two worlds. It&#39;s the only way to seal the Leviathan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia frowned. &#34;Seal? Not destroy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin shook her head. &#34;The Leviathan is primal chaos. It can&#39;t be killed, only contained. And the cost&#34; Her voice faltered, her eyes finally lifting to meet Sophia&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cost is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war room was nervous. Tharros paced, his golden eyes burning with frustration, while Kael stood by the map table, his face as cold as the abyss. Arin sat quietly, her fingers wrapped tightly around the tablet. Sophia&#39;s heart ached as she saw the fear etched on each face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There has to be another way,&#34; Kael said, breaking the quiet. &#34;We can&#39;t just accept this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s speech was calm but firm. &#34;This isn&#39;t about acceptance. It&#39;s about understanding. The message is clear. Sophia is the bridge. Without her, the Leviathan cannot be contained.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stopped pacing, his eyes fixed on Arin. &#34;You&#39;re asking us to sacrifice her. That&#39;s not a price I&#39;m willing to pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gulped hard, the weight of their words pressing down on her. &#34;We don&#39;t even know what it means yet. Let&#39;s not jump to conclusions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s fists clenched. &#34;Prophecies are riddles. They&#39;re meant to confuse and mislead. We need a real plan, not blind faith.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Do you think I want this? I&#39;ve been looking over these texts for hours. Everything points to Sophia. She&#39;s not just part of the forecast; she&#39;s the key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent again, the air thick with anxiety. Sophia took a deep breath, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. &#34;We don&#39;t have time to argue. The Leviathan is already breaking through our defenses. If I&#39;m the key, we need to figure out how to use that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia found herself alone with Tharros in the quiet of the observation room. The glow of Aquaria&#39;s bioluminescent towers filtered through the water, leaving shimmering patterns on the walls. Tharros stood at the window, his shoulders tense, his hands clasped behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re angry,&#34; Sophia said softly, stepping closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, his golden eyes piercing. &#34;I&#39;m more than angry. I&#39;m furious. At the forecast. At the Leviathan. At myself for not being able to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s chest tightened. &#34;I&#39;m not asking for protection, Tharros. I&#39;m asking for trust. If this is what it takes to save Aquaria, I have to try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if it costs you your life?&#34; His voice cracked, the vulnerability cutting through his usual stoic attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out, putting a hand on his arm. &#34;We don&#39;t know what it will cost yet. But if we do nothing, everyone will pay the price. You taught me that sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the greater good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; face softened, his hand covering hers. &#34;Then we&#39;ll face it together. Whatever happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the library, Arin spread out the tablet alongside scrolls of old Whale Song records. Kael stood by, his arms crossed, while Sophia leaned over the glowing symbols, trying to make sense of the mysterious text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bridge,&#34; Sophia whispered. &#34;It has to mean more than just a connection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded. &#34;The text implies a merging of forces. Surface and sea, magic and science. You&#39;re the only one who embodies all those elements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s jaw tensed. &#34;And what happens when this bridge is formed? Does she just vanish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s silence was answer enough. Kael slammed his hand on the table, the sound echoing through the chamber. &#34;This is madness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael,&#34; Sophia said gently, her voice steady despite the fear eating at her. &#34;We&#39;re wasting time. The Leviathan is getting stronger. If we don&#39;t move, we&#39;ll lose everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s gaze softened as he looked at her, his anger giving way to raw feeling. &#34;I just don&#39;t want to lose you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia managed a small smile. &#34;You won&#39;t. Not if we do this right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hours passed, the pieces began to fall into place. The ancient texts spoke of a ritual, a convergence of energies that would create a seal strong enough to contain the Leviathan. It needed a focal point-the bridge-to channel the combined forces of magic and technology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood at the middle of the war room, her voice steady as she laid out the plan. &#34;We&#39;ll use the palace&#39;s core as the ritual site. Its energy amplifiers can transmit the magic. Arin, you&#39;ll hold the spell. Tharros and Kael, your power will settle it. And I&#34; She stopped, her gaze sweeping over them. &#34;I&#39;ll be the conduit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stepped forward. &#34;You&#39;re asking us to risk everything on a prophecy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia met his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m asking you to trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded reluctantly. &#34;If this is what it takes, we&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s speech was softer than usual. &#34;Then we&#39;d better not fail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s attack intensified as the ritual started. The city shook under the force of its rage, the barriers flickering dangerously. Inside the core chamber, the air was thick with magic and anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood in the middle of the glowing platform, her heart pounding as the energy swirled around her. Arin&#39;s chants filled the room, her magic weaving intricate patterns that shimmered in the air. Tharros and Kael stood at opposite ends, their power rushing into the spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s roar echoed through the depths, a sound that made Sophia&#39;s blood run cold. She closed her eyes, focusing on the link between them all. She felt the pull of the surface, the weight of the sea, the raw power of magic and science converging within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost there,&#34; Arin said, her voice strained. &#34;Hold on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The energy reached its peak, a blinding light filling the room. Sophia&#39;s body shook as the forces coursed through her, threatening to tear her apart. But she held on, her mind fixed on the faces of those she was fighting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, just as the light began to dim, a new sound cut through the chaos. A crack, like breaking glass. Sophia&#39;s eyes flew open, her heart sinking as she saw the platform beneath her splintering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s wrong,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s roar got louder, its form pressing closer to the city. Sophia&#39;s gaze met Tharros&#39;, a single thought passing between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trial by Magic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The platform underneath Sophia moaned, fissures appearing quicker than anybody could respond. The rush of magic in the chamber changed dangerously, the brilliance in the air diminishing as the Leviathan&#39;s roar became louder. Tharros was the first to move, his golden aura radiating as he reached for Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, get back!&#34; He yelled, his voice cutting through the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could react, the energy surrounding her twisted. A burst of strength swept upward, swallowing her fully. The last thing she saw was Tharros&#39; anguished gaze as the light engulfed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the light faded, Sophia found herself in a completely different environment. The room was vanished, replaced by an infinite sea of gleaming water. She floats weightlessly, her movements sluggish and dreamy. The silence was unsettling, pressing against her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where am I?&#34; She murmured, her voice unusually quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A person appeared in front of her, moving and flickering like a mirror in rippling water. It was Arin, but not quite. Her features were sharper, and her eyes shone with an intensity Sophia had never seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your trial,&#34; the apparition repeated, her voice echoing. &#34;A test to prove you are ready to wield Aquaria&#39;s magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart pounded. &#34;Trial? I do not comprehend. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spectral Arin inclined her head. &#34;You have been chosen as the bridge, but your connection is not complete. To fight the Leviathan, you must first confront yourself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia opened her mouth to complain, but the figure raised a hand, causing the water surrounding her to move. Shapes began to appear in the distance, fuzzy and indistinct. As they got closer, Sophia&#39;s chest clenched. They were memories-fragments from her past, experiences she had hidden deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first scene settled within the clean white walls of a research facility. Sophia recognized it immediately. The room where she first saw Tharros in his dragon form. She saw herself standing near the containment tank, her countenance a mix of astonishment and horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; memory version hissed, his golden scales gleaming as he lunged for the glass. Sophia flinched, the memories stinging deeper than she anticipated. She&#39;d been horrified at the time, unsure how to reconcile her scientific interest with the inescapable reality of his sentience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You doubted him,&#34; the apparition&#39;s voice repeated. &#34;You doubted yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clinched her fist. &#34;I wasn&#39;t sure what to trust. Everything I believed I knew about the universe was broken in that moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phantom moved closer, her gaze piercing. &#34;And now?&#34; &#34;Do you believe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia met her gaze, her words steady. &#34;Yes. I have seen what&#39;s at risk. I believe in Tharros. In Aquaria. I believe in myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memories faded, and the scene melted into the ocean. Sophia didn&#39;t have time to regain her breath before the next one appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was back in the trenches, with the corrupted serpents crawling through the murky blackness. Her scanner buzzed furiously in her hand as the throbbing mass of depravity approached. Sophia&#39;s gut churned as she noticed herself hesitating, her fingers quivering as she adjusted the device.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were afraid,&#34; the phantom stated, her tone harsh. &#34;I am afraid of failure. Afraid to be weak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s jaw stiffened. &#34;Of course, I was scared. But I didn&#39;t let that stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phantom motioned toward the scene. &#34;Show me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia took a deep breath and stepped into the recollection. The serpents snarled as their perverted forms lunged toward her. This time, she did not falter. She raised the scanner, her hands firm, and initiated the pulse. The energy exploded outward, striking the bulk and pushing the monsters back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the memories faded, the apparition&#39;s expression softened. &#34;You&#39;re stronger than you realize. But strength alone is insufficient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final sequence was the most challenging. Sophia stood at her childhood home, the familiar creak of the floorboards beneath her boots. Her parents&#39; voices resonated through the kitchen, their tone light and playful. But she knew how this recollection would end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She witnessed her younger self-only fifteen-argue with her father over her future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t live your life chasing the impossible,&#34; her father had said. &#34;Science has its limits, Sophia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Limits?&#34; Sophia had responded, her voice shaking. &#34;That is exactly why I need to keep pushing. &#34;Someone has to believe in more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The argument had marked the beginning of a schism that had never fully mended. Her father&#39;s words had sown seeds of doubt that remained, hinting that she was seeking a dream too huge to achieve.</p>
