                <p>Sweetness and happiness seemed to have planted their seeds around me since then, and everything I experienced yesterday inside the sea of flowers seemed to have formed a new dream inside my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dream, Isaac and I were happily running around inside the sea of flowers. The dream was long, and when I opened my eyes, the warmth was still around me as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a daze, I opened my eyes. Isaac seemed to have woken up for a long time, he held me in his arms and stroked my cheek with one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now? It&#39;s ten o&#39;clock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of his voice, my eyes snapped open. I turned my head gently, and the sunlight seemed to be baking the hotel curtains, and I could feel its temperature from ten feet away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my God! I can&#39;t believe I slept for so long.&#34; This time I suddenly remembered Isaac&#39;s madness yesterday, and I immediately pretended to be angry and pinched his arm. &#34;It&#39;s all your fault, I feel like I&#39;m falling apart right now, it&#39;s your fault I slept so late!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you obviously enjoyed it too...&#34; Isaac yelped in mock pain, but his face quickly donned a wicked grin that made me bite my teeth hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t resist picking up a pillow and slamming it into his face, which he dodged in mock fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We frolicked for a while until all the pillows were thrown away around me and I stopped, looking at the mess all over the floor as we looked at each other and laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I say, we should go out. I&#39;ll take you somewhere new today.&#34; Isaac began to straighten his clothes, while the familiar mysterious smile remained on his face. &#34;This dress is for you; the place we go today should go well with this dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A dress like this?&#34; I looked at the pink dress doubtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through his mind, all I could know was a happy blue and pink, the emotion that seemed to tell me he was taking me somewhere interesting, which made me look forward to it even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you just tell me what you&#39;re arranging?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course you can&#39;t, I&#39;m going to make you live in surprise for the next seven days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at his expression and pouted my mouth, but it was as if the room inside me was filled with candy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Candy, today he seemed to have candy hidden inside his emotions. What kind of place could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking this way, I speeded up my speed of organizing myself, and after I finished washing up and I put on that pink dress, I stood in front of the mirror and looked carefully at myself inside the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does such a lovely dress suit me? I&#39;m a negotiator.&#34; I turned around in the mirror, the whole dress was pink with white floral patterns and lace embellished around it, but overall it didn&#39;t look flashy, it looked small and cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not a negotiator now, I swear today you&#39;re going to be the most beautiful princess.&#34; Isaac hugged me from behind my back and kissed me behind the ear. I let out a gasp when I saw him inside the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had somehow dressed in a suit, elegant lines stretched across his chest, and he had his golden brown hair deliberately combed to look like a fairy tale prince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac ...... you.&#34; I looked at his appearance, surprised to say no words, the sunlight made his caramel pupils glow, the air seemed to be filled with the smell of elegance and sweetness, he looked so seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m even more curious, I really can&#39;t wait any longer.&#34; The anticipation became strong in my heart, and we went out and got on yesterday&#39;s pumpkin carriage after a deep kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The White Pack really was a beautiful place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the vibration of the carriage, I looked at the surrounding streets through the window of the pumpkin carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday Isaac closed the pumpkin carriage window in order to give me an unexpected surprise, but today he opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streets of the White Pack seem to be forbidden for ordinary vehicles to drive in, probably to prevent the unpleasant exhaust of vehicles from affecting the mood of travelers, but also for the safety of travelers. I was able to see some strangely shaped carriages on the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people who came to the White Pack seemed to come for tourism, and everyone&#39;s faces were wearing smiles displaying different feelings, from deeply affectionate partners to parents and their children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is the White Pack able to become such a beautiful pack?&#34; I gazed at the pedestrians and carriages in the streets, and the art-like carvings of the surrounding buildings, and this pack seemed to be a pack that was not tainted with dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not just beautiful. The White Pack is actually very powerful, it&#39;s an ancient and powerful pack.&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice rang in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The powerful White Pack never starts any war, their faith seems to be peace, they build a beautiful environment and welcome any werewolf to visit, but they also forbid any werewolf to fight here.&#34; When he said this, a smile appeared on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Many werewolves are convinced by their beauty, not to mention that there is a place where they can travel, and the werewolves do not reject this, and all the werewolves are forbidden to wage war against the White Pack by default.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is really a magical place.&#34; I took a deep breath and looked out the window, but the next moment something let my expression change slightly because I noticed a white carriage behind me that seemed to have followed us for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why have they been behind us, are they following us?&#34; I tried to feel the thoughts of the people inside the carriage, but I had no way to sense what they were thinking because the distance was too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence that the White Pack is forbidding any werewolves from conflicting here.&#34; Isaac didn&#39;t seem too concerned, but used his arm to gather me into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think too much about it, this is our honeymoon, and we&#39;ll be there soon.&#34; He stroked my hair with his hand, the light inside his eyes soon made my thoughts empty. I looked at his upright nose and thin lips obsessively. My other hand involuntarily stroked the outline of his chest muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re still in the early stages of pregnancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You jerk; you&#39;re ruining such a good vibe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers on his chest increased in force, and a sound came from inside the carriage as he pretended to be in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it, look ahead, we&#39;ll be there soon.&#34; After frolicking for a while, I heard his voice, curiosity became stronger in my heart and I stuck my head out of the window at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I saw the colors in the distance, I was almost speechless with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this where you&#39;re taking me?&#34; I covered my lips, and at this time I understood why I could feel a candy-like sweetness from inside his emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pink color I saw in front of me showed it all, a sweetness that reached my lungs from a long distance, the complex in front of me was as beautiful as the castle where Barbie lived, or maybe it was simply the world of Princess Barbie. Once, when my parents were still alive, I fantasized that I was Princess Barbie. I did not think that today my fantasy became a reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The giant Ferris wheel was decorated like a lollipop, which was definitely the most gigantic lollipop I had ever seen, some candy-like hot air balloons floating in mid-air, many people going in and out wearing dresses that matched the scenery, and many people playing role-playing games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you happy with the surprise? This is a candy paradise built by the White Pack, and our dresses were prepared by me specifically for entering this paradise.&#34; I saw the smile that raised the corners of Isaac&#39;s mouth, his elegantly combed hair blowing gently in the wind, and his suit that made him look more elegant than a prince in a fairy tale today, and I couldn&#39;t hold back any longer at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Isaac, I really do love you so much!&#34; I kissed him fiercely on the lips and then held his hand as I jumped impatiently from the pumpkin carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never thought my honeymoon with him would actually make me feel this happy. Every second of this period was engraved in my mind. I will keep these memories for eternity. These were the proof of my love with Isaac in the river of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t run so fast, be careful, there are many people in this paradise!&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice came from behind me, but I didn&#39;t slow down because I couldn&#39;t control the mood I was in now that I was so excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t imagine the power of a woman confronted with her childhood fantasies.&#34; I laughed happily and sprinted towards the gates of Paradise. This was definitely the happiest time of my life.</p>
