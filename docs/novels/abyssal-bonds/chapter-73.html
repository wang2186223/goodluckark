                <p>But it was in the final room that Sophia spotted what they&#39;d come for-a small, leather-bound book in a glass case. Even from across the room, she could feel its power calling to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, I see you&#39;ve noticed my prize possession,&#34; Morrow said, following her gaze. &#34;The logbook of Captain Elias Blackwater, 1692. He claimed to have found a passage to another world beneath the waves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I?&#34; Sophia asked, gesturing to the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morrow hesitated, then nodded. &#34;The glass is specially treated to protect against deterioration. Please don&#39;t touch the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia approached slowly, Arin at her side. Through the glass, she could make out faded script on the yellowed pages. One illustration showed seven crystal-like objects arranged in a circle, labeled in an ancient script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seven keys to the forgotten realm,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morrow&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;You can read that? The language has never been translated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia realized her mistake too late. She felt Arin tense beside her, magic gathering at her fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Morrow,&#34; Sophia said carefully, &#34;I think we should be honest with each other. We know what this book contains, and we need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you now?&#34; Morrow walked to a nearby desk and pressed a button. Metal shutters slid down over the windows with a heavy clang. &#34;I&#39;ve been collecting objects related to the underwater world for forty years, Dr. Rodriguez. Did you think I wouldn&#39;t recognize what you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached up and pulled aside his collar, revealing three small slits on his neck-vestigial gills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Aquarian,&#34; Arin breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Half,&#34; Morrow corrected. &#34;My mother was mer, my father human. I can&#39;t survive underwater, but I inherited certain... sensitivities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He circled them slowly. &#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for someone to come for the book. The signs are all there-unusual tides, strange lights in deep waters, fish behaving abnormally. The barrier is failing, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shared a look with Arin, then nodded. &#34;Yes. We managed to close a portal three weeks ago, but a crack remained. It&#39;s growing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the keystones are awakening,&#34; Morrow concluded. &#34;I&#39;ve felt it. That&#39;s why you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved to the case and placed his hand on a hidden scanner. The glass slid open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve protected this book for decades, waiting for its rightful guardians,&#34; he said, lifting the logbook carefully. &#34;But I need to know-are you trying to strengthen the barrier, or tear it down completely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t want to tear anything down,&#34; Sophia said firmly. &#34;We want balance. The natural flow between worlds that existed before the Great Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morrow studied her face, then Arin&#39;s. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The captain found one of the keystones,&#34; he explained, opening the book to a marked page. &#34;It showed him visions of the time before the separation. He spent his life searching for the others, but only found clues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed to a series of numbers on the page. &#34;These aren&#39;t just coordinates. They&#39;re a code that changes with the phases of the moon. Solve it, and you&#39;ll find the surface keystone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just giving this to us?&#34; Arin asked suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morrow smiled sadly. &#34;I&#39;m dying, Ms. Blacktide. Cancer. The doctors give me months. I&#39;d rather see this book used for its purpose than locked away in some museum after I&#39;m gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed the book into Sophia&#39;s hands. As their fingers touched, she felt a spark of connection-the same feeling she experienced with Tharros, Kael, and Arin, but fainter, like an echo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re part of this too,&#34; she realized. &#34;The prophecy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A minor player,&#34; Morrow agreed. &#34;A keeper, not a wielder. My role was to preserve until you came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden tremor shook the building. Outside, lightning flashed across the sky, illuminating the ocean below-where a massive whirlpool had formed off the coast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beginning,&#34; Morrow said grimly. &#34;The corruption is spreading faster than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clutched the book tightly. &#34;We need to solve this quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take my research too,&#34; Morrow said, grabbing a flash drive from his desk. &#34;Everything I&#39;ve collected on the keystones and the ancient world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another tremor, stronger this time, knocked artifacts from their shelves. The lights flickered ominously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go,&#34; Morrow urged. &#34;I&#39;ve done my part. The rest is up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they rushed back to the car, Sophia glanced at her phone. Three missed calls from Dr. Chen, and a text: &#34;Something&#39;s happening in the ocean. News crews everywhere. Call me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem,&#34; she told Arin, showing her the screen. &#34;The world is noticing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin gunned the engine, speeding back down the coastal road. The whirlpool in the ocean had grown, its center a sickly purple color that made Sophia&#39;s stomach turn. From its depths, something was rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to warn Tharros and Kael,&#34; Sophia said, opening the ancient logbook. &#34;And we need to find this surface keystone immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if in answer, her phone chimed with a message from Tharros: &#34;Found first keystone. Also found something impossible. Get back to Aquaria now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia looked from the phone to the growing chaos in the ocean, her heart pounding with fear and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too late,&#34; she murmured as dark shapes began to emerge from the whirlpool. &#34;It&#39;s already here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>City of Ghosts</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should wait for the others,&#34; Kael said, his silver eyes scanning the abandoned streets of the ancient city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros shook his head, the keystone pulsing in his palm. &#34;There&#39;s no time. Feel that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded. A strange vibration hummed through the water around them, growing stronger by the minute. Something was awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood at the edge of an impossible discovery - a complete city preserved beneath the ocean floor, hidden for thousands of years. Buildings of crystal and strange metal stretched into the darkness, their architecture unlike anything in modern Aquaria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Atlantis,&#34; Tharros murmured, still unable to believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The texts called it Lumaria,&#34; Kael corrected, pointing to symbols etched into a nearby column. &#34;The first kingdom, where all were one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The keystone&#39;s light grew brighter as they moved deeper into the city. Strange shadows danced across the ancient structures, giving them an eerie, living quality. Though buried for millennia, no silt or decay marred the buildings. They looked as if their inhabitants had simply vanished moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tower,&#34; Tharros said, pointing to a massive spire that rose above the other structures. Blue light pulsed from its peak, matching the rhythm of the keystone. &#34;That&#39;s where we need to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They swam through empty plazas and past silent homes. Preserved furniture could be seen through windows, meals left half-eaten on tables, toys abandoned mid-play. It was as if the entire population had been snatched away in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened here?&#34; Kael wondered, his voice hushed despite the emptiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros shook his head. &#34;The Division, maybe? The texts speak of a great sacrifice to separate the worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached the central tower, Tharros felt the familiar pull of draconic magic - ancient and powerful, yet somehow familiar. The keystone hummed in his hand, responding to the energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strange,&#34; Kael said, touching the tower&#39;s outer wall. &#34;It feels alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, beneath their fingers, the surface seemed to pulse like skin over a beating heart. Symbols similar to those on the keystone covered every inch, glowing softly in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no door,&#34; Tharros observed, swimming around the base.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael studied the symbols more closely. &#34;Maybe we don&#39;t need one.&#34; He placed his hand on a circular pattern. &#34;This matches your mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros touched the dragon symbol on his chest, which had begun to glow in response to the tower. Understanding, he pressed his palm against the wall where Kael indicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surface rippled like water, then parted, revealing an entrance. Inside, a spiral ramp wound upward through the tower&#39;s core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After you, Your Majesty,&#34; Kael said with a nervous smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interior was filled with soft blue light that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere. As they ascended the ramp, they passed level after level of preserved knowledge. Crystal shelves lined with memory spheres, scrolls made of unknown material, and devices whose purpose they could only guess at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Abyssal Archives,&#34; Tharros breathed. &#34;Not lost - hidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the ramp above them, something moved. Tharros froze, signaling Kael to be still. A figure drifted into view - humanoid but clearly not human. Its body was translucent, revealing a complex network of glowing lines within. When it turned, its eyes were pools of pure blue light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guardian,&#34; Kael whispered, reaching for his weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Tharros stayed his hand. &#34;Wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure studied them without speaking, its head tilted in curiosity. Then it raised a hand, pointing upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it wants us to follow,&#34; Tharros said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guardian led them higher into the tower, past more floors of preserved knowledge. Finally, they reached the top level - a circular chamber dominated by a pool of shimmering liquid in its center. Hovering above the pool was a glowing orb the size of Tharros&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guardian gestured toward the pool, then faded from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this place?&#34; Kael asked, approaching the edge of the pool cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros examined the symbols carved around its rim. &#34;A memory vault, I think. The oldest form of Aquarian record-keeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held the keystone over the pool. Immediately, the liquid began to swirl, changing colors from blue to gold. The orb above pulsed in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we&#39;re supposed to...&#34; Tharros didn&#39;t finish the sentence. Acting on instinct, he placed the keystone in the center of the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The effect was immediate and dramatic. The liquid engulfed the crystal, and the orb above expanded, filling the chamber with light. Images formed in the air around them - moving pictures of a world long forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They saw Lumaria in its glory - a vast civilization that spanned land and sea. People of mixed heritage moved freely between environments. Some had gills and lungs, others scales and skin. Dragons flew through the skies while mer-people swam the depths. Magic and technology worked in harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were one people,&#34; Kael realized. &#34;Not separated as we are now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The images shifted, showing a darker time. A shadow spreading across the land and sea. Corruption that turned friend against friend, brother against brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The First Corruption,&#34; Tharros murmured, recognizing the purple energy that was all too familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The visions continued, showing seven leaders - representatives of the main bloodlines - gathering to make a terrible decision. Using seven keystones of immense power, they performed a ritual that split their world into separate realms - land, sea, and sky - sealing the corruption away but also dividing their people forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final image showed the seven leaders hiding the keystones, knowing that someday they might be needed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The prophecy,&#34; Kael said. &#34;When the four reunite, the barrier between worlds will be restored to its proper form.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The orb contracted, the images fading. From the pool rose the keystone, now glowing with renewed purpose. Beside it floated a crystal tablet covered in ancient script.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros took both objects carefully. &#34;Coordinates,&#34; he said, examining the tablet. &#34;To the other keystones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael studied the tablet over his shoulder. &#34;There&#39;s more. A warning.&#34; His expression grew grim as he translated. &#34;The Division was temporary. A thousand generations was all the seal would hold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how many generations has it been?&#34; Tharros asked, though he suspected the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly one thousand,&#34; Kael replied. &#34;The seal is failing, Tharros. That&#39;s what the crack in the Mariana Trench really is - the beginning of the end of the Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tremor shook the tower, sending ancient artifacts tumbling from their shelves. The water around them vibrated with discordant energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get back,&#34; Tharros said, securing the keystone and tablet in his pack. &#34;Warn the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they rushed back down the spiral ramp, the tremors intensified. The tower&#39;s inner light flickered ominously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s wrong,&#34; Kael called out. &#34;This doesn&#39;t feel like a natural quake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the bottom level just as a massive shock wave tore through the city. Outside, the preserved buildings began to crumble as silt and debris rained down from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The city is waking up,&#34; Tharros realized with horror. &#34;Our presence activated something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They burst through the tower entrance to find the ancient streets in chaos. The ground beneath them heaved and split, revealing deeper chambers below. From these openings, more translucent guardians emerged - hundreds of them, their eyes now burning red instead of blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not happy we took the keystone,&#34; Kael said, drawing his blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros transformed partially, scales covering his arms and back, claws extending from his fingers. &#34;We fight our way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first wave of guardians surged toward them, forcing them back toward the tower. Though Kael&#39;s blade passed through their bodies with little effect, Tharros&#39;s dragon fire seemed to hurt them, making them retreat momentarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There!&#34; Kael pointed to a gap in the swarm. &#34;If we can reach the city&#39;s edge, we might find another way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They fought their way through the ancient streets, the city crumbling around them. Above, the ocean floor that had hidden Lumaria for millennia was beginning to crack, letting in streams of water and sand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost there,&#34; Tharros called as they neared the city boundary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they could reach it, the ground before them erupted. From the depths rose a guardian unlike the others - massive and pulsing with energy, its form shifting between humanoid and something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Keeper,&#34; Kael gasped, recognizing the figure from ancient texts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Keeper&#39;s voice filled their minds, speaking a language neither understood yet somehow comprehended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cycle begins again. The Division ends. Choose wisely, bearers of the mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It raised a massive hand, and the world around them twisted. Tharros felt himself being pulled in a thousand directions at once, the keystone burning against his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the chaos, a familiar sensation brushed against his mind - Sophia, reaching for him through their bond. He grasped the connection desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia! We found something - ancient city - Division ending - get to the palace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Keeper&#39;s hand closed into a fist, and darkness claimed them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miles away, in a car speeding along a coastal highway, Sophia gasped as Tharros&#39;s message crashed into her mind. Beside her, Arin swerved the car in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Arin demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clutched the ancient logbook, her face pale. &#34;They&#39;re in trouble. And I think they just woke something up that&#39;s been sleeping for a very long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the ocean below the cliff, the purple whirlpool grew larger, and the dark shapes moving within it began to take form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Collector&#39;s Price</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gripped the ancient logbook tighter as Arin swerved the car around another hairpin turn. The coastal highway stretched before them like a ribbon, hugging cliffs that plunged straight into the churning sea below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say it again,&#34; Arin demanded, her knuckles white on the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you exactly what I felt,&#34; Sophia said, trying to keep her voice steady. &#34;Tharros reached out through our bond. They found some kind of ancient city, something about the Division ending, and we need to get to the palace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then nothing?&#34; Arin&#39;s green eyes flashed with worry. &#34;Just... silence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, the emptiness in her mind where Tharros&#39;s presence should be felt like an open wound. &#34;It was like he was ripped away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purple whirlpool they&#39;d glimpsed from the cliff edge haunted her thoughts. Those dark shapes moving beneath the surface couldn&#39;t be anything good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t reach the palace without help,&#34; Arin said, pulling into a small coastal town. &#34;Not with whatever&#39;s happening down there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The town of Crescent Bay looked ordinary enough - fishing boats bobbing in the harbor, tourists browsing gift shops. But Sophia knew better. Since discovering her true nature, she&#39;d learned to spot the hidden signs of magic woven into the human world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Collector lives here?&#34; she asked as they parked near the waterfront.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded grimly. &#34;Marcus Blackwood. If anyone has information about surface keystones, it&#39;s him. His family has been gathering magical artifacts for centuries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And he&#39;ll help us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For a price,&#34; Arin said, her mouth tightening. &#34;He always wants a price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Collector&#39;s shop sat at the end of a narrow alley, its windows dusty and filled with odd trinkets. A wooden sign swung gently in the breeze: &#34;Blackwood Antiquities - By Appointment Only.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin didn&#39;t bother knocking. She pushed open the door, sending a cluster of bells into frantic jingling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The interior smelled of old books, sea salt, and something else - something ancient. Glass cases lined the walls, filled with objects that seemed ordinary at first glance but gave off a strange energy Sophia could feel prickling against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well,&#34; came a voice from the shadows. &#34;The sea witch returns to my humble shop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus Blackwood emerged from behind a beaded curtain. He was younger than Sophia expected, maybe forty, with dark hair streaked with silver and eyes that seemed to shift color in the dim light. He wore an old-fashioned waistcoat covered in tiny pockets, each sewn shut with different colored threads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need information,&#34; Arin said bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always do,&#34; Marcus replied with a smile that didn&#39;t reach his eyes. He turned to Sophia, studying her with unsettling intensity. &#34;And you&#39;ve brought a dragon&#39;s mate with you. How interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt exposed under his gaze. &#34;How did you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The marks on your skin whisper secrets to those who know how to listen,&#34; he said, circling her like a shark. &#34;Three magical signatures intertwined with your own. Quite remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have time for games,&#34; Arin snapped. &#34;We need to find a keystone. One hidden on land.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39;s eyes gleamed. &#34;Ah, the keystones of Lumaria. I wondered when someone would come looking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart skipped. &#34;You know about them?&#34;</p>
