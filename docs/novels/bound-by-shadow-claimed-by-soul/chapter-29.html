                <p>&#34;Then why would you need to know? Some things are better left untouched until such a time as they are needed. We need every resource we can utilize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think we would let them fight even if they could phase?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen&#39;s head whipped around and looked up at her mate, then down at Jacque. &#34;Did I hear him correctly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you mean, did he just imply that he can control your actions by telling you what you can and cannot do? Then yes, Watson, you heard him correctly.&#34; Jacque cocked an eyebrow at Fane, who was growling at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do we really have to go over this again?&#34; Jen asked Decebel in an exasperated manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told you, Jennifer, I will not allow you to be put in danger.&#34; Decebel&#39;s voice was calm and reasonable, which only ticked Jen off more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you keep Cynthia or Crina from fighting?&#34; Jen had pulled out of his grasp and was glaring at him with her hands on her hips, chin jutted out defiantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hell it is,&#34; Jen snarled. She turned to look at Alina. &#34;Are you going to fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina nodded as she took Vasile&#39;s hand, indicating that where her mate went, she followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen looked back at Decebel. &#34;I&#39;m your mate, I stand by your side. Not behind you, not in front of you. Where you go, I go. Do what you have to in order to get over it. Throw your hissy fit, snarl your teeth, glare at me with your freaky glowing eyes - if absolutely necessary, punch a hole in the wall - but you will deal with this and get over it. You cannot put me in a bubble unless your goal is to suffocate me. Got it?&#34; Jen was toe-to-toe with her mate, looking straight into his amber eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel growled and then shocked her by gripping the back of her neck and kissing her roughly. When he pulled back, he wasn&#39;t any less agitated or angry, but there was resignation in his eyes. &#34;If anything happens to you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chillax, man. If I kick the bucket, so do you. So, no worries about you tearing the world apart or Vasile having to kill you,&#34; Jen interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Man, you have a way with words,&#34; Jacque muttered to her mouthy friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just telling it like it is, Jac. No need to sugarcoat it.&#34; Jen turned back around to face Peri, stepping back so that she was pressed against Decebel&#39;s chest and stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we have to do?&#34; Jacque asked. Fane had tried arguing with her through their bond, but Jacque had shut him right down. Fane wasn&#39;t quite as stubborn as Decebel, so he relented more quickly, but he was still angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Under the light of the full moon, your mates will pour passion vine-infused water over you. The pull of the moon is powerful; I can amplify it and call on the Great Luna. The passion vine will absorb into your pores and call upon the passion of your wolf. The last part is the blood of your mate, which your wolf will recognize and be drawn to. All three combined with a little Fae magic and your wolves will surface.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when exactly is the next full moon?&#34; Jen asked Peri.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri smiled mischievously. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t you know? It just happens to be tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen felt Decebel tense behind her. She figured that, like herself, he hadn&#39;t expected it to be so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally stepped up to her two best friends and smiled gentle. &#34;You guys are going to be okay. And I will admit, I&#39;m slightly jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll share my fleas with you. No need for me to be stingy,&#34; Jen teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cynthia, Crina, and Alina had come over and each hugged Jacque and Jen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two are going to be kick ass she-wolves.&#34; Crina grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there any other kind?&#34; Jen asked, cocking her a single eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not in our pack,&#34; Cynthia piped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night fell over the tavern and the moon boldly lit the sky. Jen and Jacque said their farewells as they headed out the door with Peri, Fane, and Decebel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque had spoken with her father and he was about as receptive as Fane and Decebel had been. She gently reminded him that she was an adult and it was her choice. He hadn&#39;t said anything more, but his face remained in a permanent scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri led them out into a clearing near the opening of the woods. She had told them she would be cloaking them so the witch would not disturb the ritual if she happened to be seeking them out. Which she most likely was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque and Jen both wore a simple pullover shift, but - thanks to Fae magic - were being protected from the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri directed Fane and Decebel to stand with their backs to each other to give their mates privacy from the other male. The girls each stood in front of their mate and waited for Peri to tell them what to do next. They watched as the fairy closed her eyes. Her lips began moving with silent words. The air around her began to shimmer and in each of her hands a large basin of water appeared. The water had a purple tint to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri handed Fane a basin and then handed Decebel a basin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remove your shifts,&#34; Peri told Jen and Jacque. &#34;Then, males, you will pour the potion over your mate. The potion will last until all of her has been covered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen pulled the shift over her head and, though it was the first time she had been truly naked in front of her mate, she boldly looked him in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel&#39;s lips lifted in a crooked smile. &#34;You&#39;re beautiful,&#34; he told her through their bond and without hesitation began to pour the passion vine potion over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen had expected it to be cold, but the water was surprisingly warm. It flowed over her head and down her face to her shoulders, arms, chest, and back - all the way to her toes. Her skin felt like tiny pins were pricking it all over. Jen watched her skin begin to shimmer and felt something in her pushing. Just like when she had completed the Blood Rites, she could feel her wolf, only it was much stronger. The water finally stopped flowing and she looked up at Decebel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri then instructed them to take the blood of their mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel stepped close to Jen and leaned down so she was able to reach his neck. She kissed him once on the lips and then down his jaw to the same place she had bitten him during their bonding. The stirring in her was getting frantic and she was beginning to feel restless, like she couldn&#39;t stand still. Her teeth lengthened and her mouth opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she sunk her teeth into Decebel&#39;s flesh, she let out a low moan as his sweet blood hit her mouth. Decebel wrapped his arms around her small waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never tire of you taking from me what you need,&#34; he whispered breathlessly in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen swallowed several large gulps and somehow instinctively knew when to pull back. Decebel&#39;s eyes were closed and his lips slightly parted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;D-d-decebel...&#34; Jen&#39;s voice was unsteady as she looked to her mate for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel opened his eyes, which had begun to glow amber. The glow intensified as Decebel looked into the glowing blue eyes of his mate. A low growl emitted from his chest as his own canines lengthened. Then Decebel&#39;s wolf pushed forward, seeking his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate,&#34; Jen heard Decebel&#39;s wolf boom into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen let out a soft whine and backed away from Decebel. She shuddered as something deep inside her, something primal, reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jen, don&#39;t fight it,&#34; she heard Peri say, but her voice sounded far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel stepped toward Jen and growled again. He was calling to her, calling to his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen closed her glowing eyes and felt a coldness flow over her from head to toe. For a moment, she felt like she was floating - then she landed on the hard ground. On four legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen&#39;s eyes snapped open at the realization. Her vision was so clear and her hearing was beyond amplified - she could hear animals scurry, birds&#39; wings flapping, voices coming from the tavern, and a heartbeat that sounded familiar. She felt a nudge in her side and turned her head to see Decebel in his huge wolf form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bloody hell, Dec. I&#39;m a wolf.&#34; Jen was relieved that she could still feel him in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a beautiful wolf. You have a white star shape on your muzzle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel gave her what must&#39;ve been the wolf version of a smile. Jen took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, don&#39;t ever do that again. That was creepy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel chuckled in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel?&#34; he asked her as he rubbed his head against her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amazing. I can&#39;t even describe it. I just want to run and kill someth- Okay, that&#39;s a little disturbing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black wolf and a smaller grey one - who had emerald eyes that looked like they were lined in kohl - stepped in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen realized it was Fane and Jacque. She stepped toward Jacque and nudged her, then leaned down on her front paws, sticking her butt in the air and wagging her tail. She wanted to play. Jacque mimicked her pose and took off to the right when Jen pounced.  Decebel and Fane sped off after their mates, flanking them on either side in protection. They ran through the snow, dodging under bushes and fallen trees. Jen relished the wind blowing through her fur and the cold air rushing into her lungs. The only thing that came even close to this exhilaration was kissing Decebel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I&#39;ll have to try harder if I&#39;m going to be competing with you wanting to be in your wolf form running instead of kissing your mate,&#34; Decebel teased, having heard her thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you can find ways to persuade me to stay in my human form. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying that - human form. That&#39;s just wicked crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen and Jacque ran until they were panting in exhaustion. Peri watched over them while they became accustomed to their wolf forms and smiled, having the hope in her heart that she desperately needed to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Late into the night, Jen and Jacque shared their experience with Sally and Costin, who shared the room with the two couples. They had pulled the beds to the center of the room and placed them in a circle, creating a flower shape so they could all lay with their heads toward the center and talk. Decebel and Jen had squeezed onto a single bed together. He lay on his back with one arm behind his head. Jen was sprawled across his chest, facing the others while Decebel used his free hand to run his fingers through her hair. He listened to her voice as she laughed about him chasing her and nipping her heels. He loved hearing her so happy, so worry-free, if only for this short moment in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they had all fallen silent and one by one drifted off to sleep, Decebel still lay awake. His body was curled around Jennifer&#39;s, and as he thought about what was to come, what they would be facing in a matter of days if not sooner, he pulled her closer. His worst nightmare was coming to pass. His mate would be in battle, in danger, and he might not be there to protect her. As much as he hated the idea, he also knew he couldn&#39;t cage her in. He couldn&#39;t keep her from living because he was afraid of losing her. He had to let her fight, he had to let her be her own person, not just his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days had passed since Jen and Jacque had phased for the first time. In that time, Decebel and Fane took them out several times under the watchful eye of Peri so that the girls could continue to familiarize themselves with the movement and senses of their wolves. Decebel and Fane even began teaching them the best way to attack and when it was more appropriate to run and hide. Neither Jen nor Jacque cared for the idea of hiding. When they weren&#39;t out in their wolf forms, Decebel and Fane met with the other males, discussing strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today it had been decided that tomorrow night Vasile would call Thad and Desdemona out. He wanted them to meet him on his terms, on the battlefield of his choosing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know your secret, Mona.&#34; Thad smiled at the witch, but it was not a friendly smile. Mona sat in one of the many sitting rooms in the Serbian pack mansion. She looked bored and not at all worried by Thad&#39;s declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what secret would that be, Alpha?&#34; she asked dryly as she looked at her nails, making it apparent that she found them infinitely more interesting than her present company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not helping me so I can obtain the healer, you want the healer for yourself - for your magic.&#34; Thad was standing behind the couch that Mona occupied, his hands resting on the back as he leaned over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are two healers. There is no need to be stingy, Thad.&#34; Mona&#39;s attitude was so blasé that it set Thad&#39;s wolf on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me your plan, Desdemona. You could at least give me that much respect. If you want one of the healers, I&#39;m willing to share. But we can&#39;t go into this disparately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vasile is gathering his troops.&#34; Mona stood and began to slowly pace around the room as she spoke. &#34;He has called on three other packs for aid. It will not be an easy battle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I know you, then you have something up your sleeve. What&#39;s your advantage?&#34; Thad narrowed his eyes at the witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have my own army.&#34; Mona&#39;s smile lit her whole face, but not in a way that would be considered pretty. &#34;The wild ones will do my bidding. If we add your pack to the mix, I do believe we will be the victors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The wild ones?&#34; Thad cocked his head to the side as he considered her words. &#34;Ah, you have called upon the beasts and animals of the forest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mona&#39;s face turned dark as she detected judgment in his voice. The air around her grew thick and the room darkened. &#34;You forget who I am. I am the last of my kind, the most powerful in history. I will call on the elements, the beasts - the demons from the abyss, if necessary. Know this, Thad, Alpha of the Serbian pack: I will obtain that which I seek. Do not attempt to stand in my way or I will destroy you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mona turned on her heel and, with her cloak billowing behind her, stormed out of the mansion, not giving Thad a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque&#39;s head lay in Fane&#39;s lap as they sat on the couch in front of the always-burning fire in the meeting room of the tavern. The building was quiet as everyone settled in to try and get some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, this is the eve of battle,&#34; Jacque murmured softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m assuming this is some movie reference?&#34; Fane asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque chuckled. &#34;Lord of The Rings. Eowyn tells Aragorn he can&#39;t leave them on the eve of battle when he goes looking for the cursed dead who owe his bloodline a service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen Lord of The Rings, Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but you haven&#39;t seen it a hundred times like me and my girls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Fane&#39;s turn to chuckle as he traced her lips softly with his finger. Then his eyes grew serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to be smart tomorrow, Jacquelyn,&#34; he told her firmly. &#34;I don&#39;t need you to be a hero or be brave. I need you to be smart, fight smart. Can you do that for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque pulled herself into a sitting position, but Fane wanted her closer so he pulled her onto his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can if you can,&#34; she countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did it feel to be in your wolf form?&#34; Fane asked her as he gently stroked her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque let out a deep breath. &#34;It was amazing. I mean truly amazing, Fane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fane let out a chuckle at the awe in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your color is a beautiful grey and your eyes looked like they were outlined in mascara...or eyeliner. Whatever it is you girls use,&#34; Fane told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque smirked at that, then asked, &#34;Would it have bothered you had I never been able to phase?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fane looked down into her eyes. &#34;I never expected you to be able to, Jacquelyn, and I was okay with it. The fact that you can is just a bonus. I love that I get to share that part of our lives together, but it wouldn&#39;t have lessened what we are as mates had it never been possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Jacque whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fane pulled her face toward his in order to kiss her. What started out as gentle turned into a fierce show of passion. Fane flipped them so that Jacque was lying on her back with his body over hers. He kissed her again as his right hand pushed up under the hem of her shirt. His hand wrapped around her waist, the skin-to-skin contact comforting them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque opened her eyes and heard a growl rumble from Fane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your eyes are glowing, my love,&#34; Fane whispered. &#34;It&#39;s extremely sexy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque grinned at her mate and then nipped his bottom lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think we should go somewhere a little more private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fane grinned naughtily, &#34;There is no one in here with us and the doors are closed. What could be more private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque snorted at the images Fane sent to her mind. Fane raised his eyebrows in a questioning gesture. In response, Jacque pulled his shirt up and he moved back just enough for her to pull it over his head. She ran her fingers across the marks that covered the right side of him. Fane pressed her hand flat against his chest and let her feel his heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It beats for you alone.&#34; The sincerity in his voice penetrated Jacque&#39;s better judgment and she gave into the desires of her mate. Neither of them knew what tomorrow would bring. They didn&#39;t know if this was the last night to spend in each other&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fane tugged at Jacque&#39;s shirt as his lips turned up slightly. &#34;Mrs. Lupei, you are entirely overdressed for what I have planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque laughed out loud as she helped him undress and then let him undress her. They spent the night in a tavern with no electricity, the only light and heat coming from a stone fireplace, in a room where hours before a war had been planned. They spent the night basking in their love and passion for each other and, like other times since they&#39;d mated, Fane poured his heart into loving her completely, shutting out everything else and letting her know that when he held her, when she was in his arms naked and vulnerable, she was the most beautiful and precious part of his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Decebel, where are you taking me?&#34; Jen grumbled as she was being pulled along behind him by his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a surprise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night had come to a close and everyone had headed to their rooms, Jen had been doing the same. Decebel had stopped her just as she started to climb the stairs. He&#39;d grinned that rare smile he saved just for her and asked her to come with him. They had exited the front door of the tavern and turned left, heading down the snow-covered street of the small village. Finally, just at the edge of the village, Decebel pulled her in the direction of a small cottage. It was tiny, and so cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen could see a soft glow flickering from the window. When Decebel went to open the door, Jen pulled on his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t this someone&#39;s home? We can&#39;t just walk up in there,&#34; Jen whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel winked at her. &#34;I&#39;ve got it covered, baby. Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away from her and flipped the latch on the door handle and pushed the door open. Warm air brushed across Jen&#39;s cold cheeks and she shivered from the sensation. Decebel led her inside and Jen&#39;s eyes widened at the scene before her. Her mouth dropped open as she turned in a slow circle, taking in every detail of the enchanted room before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing Jen noticed was the twinkling lights that ran around the ceiling of the room. She didn&#39;t see any cords, or anything that would cause them to light up. There were vines of white flowers that ran across the ceiling, some hanging down in places, creating a canopy above them. To the left of the front door was a small fireplace ablaze with warm, dancing flames. In front of the fireplace was a pallet made from several thick blankets, and there were two fluffy pillows on top. Her stomach growled when she saw a blanket surrounded in pillows with fruit and cheese and small cuts of meat on a platter. There were two glasses filled with a purple liquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen looked up when Decebel cleared his throat. The look on his face told Jen that he was unsure of what she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at him. &#34;You did this for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had a little help from a certain Fae,&#34; he admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s amazing, Dec.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hungry?&#34; He nodded in the direction of the blanket with the platter on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen nodded and let Decebel pull her over to the blanket. He helped her remove the coat she was wearing and, once she was sitting on the blanket, Decebel reached over and pulled her shoes and socks off for her. Jen admitted she was feeling quite special as he took care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are special,&#34; he told her as he held out a cracker with cheese and meat on it. Instead of taking it from him, she leaned forward until she was on her hands and knees and wrapped her mouth around the food he offered. As she pulled back, enjoying the taste of the food, she shivered at the growl from Decebel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s going to be like that, is it?&#34; Decebel&#39;s voice was a sensual caress against her already too sensitive skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back and forth they fed and teased each other. The tension between them was so heavy that Jen thought she might die from waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you had enough?&#34; he asked her. The double meaning was written all over his beautiful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of the food, most definitely. Of you, never.&#34; She stood and moved toward the pallet in front of the fireplace, looking over her shoulder to see him watching her with predatory eyes.  He stood from his sitting position and stalked her, his glowing amber eyes never leaving hers. Once he was standing in front of her, Decebel brushed some wisps of hair away from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured her name as he wrapped one hand behind her shoulders and the other around her waist. He lowered his head and just before their lips came in contact, he paused. He took a deep breath, taking in her vanilla and cinnamon scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are mine,&#34; he breathed against her waiting mouth, &#34;my best friend, my lover, my wife, my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Jen could respond, Decebel&#39;s lips were on hers. He did not start slowly or gently. This kiss was full of passion, built-up desire, and longing. He groaned and lifted her, wrapping her legs around his waist. He lowered them to the pallet and laid her on her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he pulled back from the kiss, Jen growled at him. She opened her eyes and smiled at the desire she saw smoldering in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, your eyes are glowing,&#34; Decebel told her as he leaned down and began placing small kisses on her face, her neck, and collarbones. Every so often he would swirl his tongue across her skin and chuckle when it drew a gasp from her. He began to slowly undress her, never taking his eyes from hers, and while he made love to her for the first time, he told her in every language he knew just what she meant to him. Soft whispers against her ear, murmured words on her skin as he kissed her. Jen had never felt more loved or treasured in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will it always be like that?&#34; Jen asked him sometime later. The firelight danced across Decebel&#39;s face as he lay on his back. Jen was propped up on her elbow, watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled over to his side, mirroring her posture, and ran a finger down where his markings adorned her skin. She shivered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope so. I hope you always respond to me just like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen&#39;s brow drew together as she looked into his eyes. &#34;Why tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it goes badly tomorrow, I want to go knowing you were mine in every way.&#34; He grinned sheepishly. &#34;Kind of selfish of me, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen laughed and Decebel loved the glow that seemed to stroke over her bare skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if this is what I get when you&#39;re being selfish, then by all means.&#34; Jen&#39;s smiled, then her brow drew together in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask you a question, Dec?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything,&#34; he told her as he tucked her hair behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it bother you that you didn&#39;t have a choice when it came to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel frowned at her. &#34;What do you mean I didn&#39;t have a choice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean as your mate. I mean, the signs are there, the pull is there, and there is really nothing you can do about it. You&#39;re just stuck with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel drew her closer to his body. &#34;Jennifer, when I was created my perfect counterpart was created as well. The one woman who could complete everything in me that is incomplete. There was no need for a choice because you are perfect for me. I don&#39;t want you to doubt what I feel for you because we are fated to be together. What I feel is real and true and stronger than anything I have ever felt before. I wouldn&#39;t change us, change you, for anything in the world.&#34; He tipped her chin up to look into her eyes. &#34;I love you, Jennifer, all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen smiled up at her mate, understanding what he meant about feeling complete. For the first time in her life she felt whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t change you either. I love you, Decebel.&#34; Jen&#39;s face was full of vulnerability when she pressed her lips to his. As she pulled back, she laughed and her eyes widened when she saw the images Decebel was sharing with her through their bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me show you how I love you,&#34; he whispered to her as he continued to send images her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are those promises?&#34; she asked as she ducked her head and looked up at him through lowered lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and rolled her on her back. He spent the rest of the night fulfilling the images he had shared.</p>
