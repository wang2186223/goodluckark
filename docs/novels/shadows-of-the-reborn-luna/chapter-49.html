                <p>Goldie and Remy were returning from the hospital with a strong and healthy Ellen. After the blood transfusion, she became energetic and strong again, almost as if nothing happened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She talked animatedly after the procedure, telling Goldie that she was happy she had come with her and sorry for scaring them so badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr Brooke persuaded them to stay the night just for observation and they agreed. There were private rooms for them in the building so Goldie was given a room. Remy retired to bed much later than she did because he was catching up with Dr Brooke. She didn&#39;t see him after the blood transfusion and one of the nurse told her that he was weak and he was likely resting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, they had dressed up and left very early, eager to get back home. Goldie was so drained from the day&#39;s events that she had slept off during the ride home. It was only when they arrived home that she finally woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled into the driveway, she could already see a few of the pack members she recognised waiting outside to welcome Ellen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale was the first person to greet Ellen, his arms outstretched to give her a huge hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you! Oh you all didn&#39;t have to come out like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the least we could do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie busied herself with getting her carry on bag out of the car, a staff rushed to take it from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help you with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They retreated inside, all of them talking animatedly and joyously. Goldie went upstairs to her room, eager to take a much needed shower and freshen up for later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chef had mentioned that he had prepared a special lunch in honour of Ellen to celebrate her good health and return. Goldie was hoping she would at least have time to nap a little before it all happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Goldie excused herself to go upstairs and freshen up, she noticed Remy&#39;s cold and withdrawn demeanor. Something was amiss, and she couldn&#39;t ignore it. He had been like that last night too, after the blood transfusion. She had assumed that it probably just had something to do with the fact that he was tired after the procedure but the more she looked at him, the more she was convinced that it was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the privacy of their bedroom, Goldie couldn&#39;t hold back her concern any longer. &#34;Remy,&#34; she began, &#34;how do you feel? Are you still weak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy replied coldly, he didn&#39;t even look at her, he just removed his watch and walked into the closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But is everything okay? You&#39;ve been so quiet since we left the hospital and I didn&#39;t even get a chance to check up on you yesterday after your procedure, the nurse said you had to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy didn&#39;t face her, his expression was still distant, she could hear him sigh. &#34;I&#39;m just tired, Valentina. It&#39;s been a long and draining day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie searched his eyes for the truth, sensing that there was more to his unease. &#34;Are you sure that&#39;s all it is? Is this about your mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy  didn&#39;t reply. Goldie continued, pressing him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I do something to upset you? This is very unlike you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy hesitated, torn between his desire to share and his reluctance to tell her what he had found out. How was he going to tell her that he found her talking to another man who she was supposed to have no memory of unless she had recovered her memories? Finally, he turned to look at her, &#34;I&#39;m going to my study. I need some space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Space?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From me?&#34; She asked and Remy shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on with him? This was very unlike him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever it is, I&#39;m here for you, Remy. We&#39;ll get through this together. You don&#39;t have to carry it all on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Remy&#39;s icy facade began to thaw, and he gave her a faint smile. &#34;Thank you, Valentina. I appreciate that.&#34; He glanced at her again and he left the room, his steps echoing in the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone in the room, Goldie picked up her phone and looked through it. Not one call from Colin so far, he was probably still having a very hard time accepting what she had told him. She wondered if he would ever call her. Perhaps she had made a mistake telling him, but she couldn&#39;t help herself, it felt good telling someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt good getting it all out of her chest. She didn&#39;t know if Colin would ever believe her, but at least she knew she tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>............</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy walked into his study, his head still replaying the moment in the hospital cafeteria, where he had sought Valentina out and found her with another man. He should have asked her about it when she asked him what was wrong earlier, but he wanted to wait a little to see what Marielle had uncovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale walked in moments later, his phone in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marielle&#39;s on the line. She wanted to speak to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy, you won&#39;t believe what I&#39;ve discovered,&#34; Marielle began, her voice laden with worry. Remy listened intently and Marielle  went on to explain how in the process of trying to find out more about Valentina, she got the contact of a witch who Valentina had been seeing for months. The witch, Madame Eloise had last contacted Valentina two months ago and was wondering if their deal was still on. The witch had reached out to Marielle again to get her contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy furrowed his brow, puzzled. &#34;Why on earth would Valentina be mixed up with a witch?  What does the witch have to do with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle hesitated before responding, her voice dropping to a whisper, &#34;Madame Eloise claims there&#39;s something very important to Valentina that she&#39;s been hiding. This is more information about Valentina than we have ever learned, apparently she&#39;s been in contact with the witch for a long time now. I think when she lost her memories, they lost contact with each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Remy pondered the mysterious connection, he suddenly remembered the moment at the hospital.  &#34;I think she might have regained her memories, Marielle. I saw her at the cafeteria, talking with a man. They seemed very familiar, especially with the way they were talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just don&#39;t understand why she wouldn&#39;t tell us if she has regained her memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s mind raced as she considered the implications of Remy&#39;s observation. &#34;If she&#39;s remembering and she&#39;s not telling you, then we need to be cautious. You know how Valentina was before the accident, she was very secretive, she could be going back to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy and Kale shared a look, Kale shrugged, he seemed to share the same sentiments with Marielle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s right Remy. If the old Valentina is back, then she&#39;s probably hiding something from you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, Marielle ventured further, &#34;Remy, I know this is a very weird question to ask, but do you like Valentina? I know since she lost her memories, the two of you have been somewhat closer, whatever&#39;s between you now, it&#39;s not the same as before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy hesitated for a moment, his heart heavy with conflicting emotions. &#34;It&#39;s impossible not to. We grew much closer when she came back. It&#39;s like she became a whole new person and now I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;ve made a mistake all along...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With the old Valentina it was easier for me not like her in that way. She made it very hard to like her. She didn&#39;t even try to like me, she didn&#39;t make an effort to even care....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s words grew even more serious, &#34;Well, now that we think she might have her memories I believe she knows she can use them to her advantage. Valentina will use your love against you, Remy. We have to be careful. Whatever is going on might be more complex than we thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy knew that Marielle was right. His relationship with Valentina was entangled in a web of secrets, memories, and potentially dangerous alliances. But when she lost her memories, there was a glimmer of hope, there was a chance between them that he had never seen before, a chance for them to be together. Valentina without all her baggage and whatever secrets she was holding on to was a joy to be around, when she wasn&#39;t trying to run away from him. And these past few days with her Remy had grown so close to her that he couldn&#39;t help but confess how he truly felt about her to her,  believing that there was a chance they could be together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hopeless for him to dream, yet he dreamed anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you connect me to the witch? I need to talk to her, maybe she would be able tell me who Valentina is hiding.&#34;</p>
