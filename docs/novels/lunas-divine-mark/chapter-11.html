                <p>Her face was torn up with gashes down her torso and legs. I pull her head on my lap and quickly put my ear to her nose to check her nose. I lay her head back on the ground and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s dead,&#34; I sigh and tell Titus and back away from her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is she and why is her body on my land?&#34; He asks me. I let out a loud sigh and looked at her lifeless body letting the memories sink back in. I open my mouth to start telling him but then I realize that he doesn&#39;t know that I was kidnaped by rogues when I was younger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you later. I think I need to tell you with Brody and Jacob,&#34; I tell him. He walks over to the body and picks something off of her. He holds it up to show me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A note?&#34; I ask. Why would there be a note on her body?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember how I told you about threats made towards us because we&#39;re mated?&#34; He asks me. I think back to the conversation and nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we just got our 2nd threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it say?&#34; I ask walking up next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I warned you to stay away. We will take back what was ours and we won&#39;t stop until I have her,&#34; he read out to the group. I was right the rouges are coming after me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will not be taken back there,&#34; James says standing up furious. His hands slam the table then he runs them through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I missing something here?&#34; Brody asks with a look of confusion on his face. I look at my parents and they gave me a nod of approval. I take in a deep breath preparing myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a seat next to Titus on the couch he was sitting on and lean on him. I saw Terry visibly tense and Kira glared at me. Pshhh like I would take her man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was maybe 15 years old I was kidnapped by rogues and held hostage for 1/2 a year. I felt Titus&#39; body tense so he put his nose in my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was this guy that starved me and another one that would do tests on me. I have a birthmark they mentioned apparently it made it where they couldn&#39;t take me as theirs.&#34; Titus started to growl but I laid my hand in his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down,&#34; I whisper to him. He tried to relax but he still had the look of revenge in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, what does this have to do with with the lady you found?&#34; Brody asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She would bring me food after they would do tests on me and help me gain my strength back,&#34; I explain. Without her, I don&#39;t think I would have made it in there. They always forgot to feed me so she saved my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would they want you back now?&#34; Jacob asks from the little corner he was standing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it has something to do with this birthmark. They would try to cut it off, burn it, all sorts of things but it still stayed like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is it still coming back,&#34; the main guy growled. He threw the knife at the wall and slammed his fist into the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a blessing there&#39;s no way to remove it from her,&#34; the other guy said. I think his name was Joshua. My body slumped on the ground with my wrist still changed to the wall. The man grabs the knife of the ground and picks my head up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will be mine soon. I will have you as mine,&#34; he says tracing the knife across my chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End of Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw my parents and James tense up. It was hard to tell but I saw their facials change. I stood up and pulled my shirt down my shoulder and showed them my birthmark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a unique shape,&#34; Brody commented. I nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I noticed that too,&#34; I said. I sat back down and leaned my head on Titis. He mindlessly starts to twirl my hair as we continue to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going on a run,&#34; Terry suddenly says and stands up and walks out the door. Kira also gets up and runs after him. Love-sick puppy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we should all take a break,&#34; Titus says and helps me off the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Brody would you mind showing our guests to their rooms?&#34; Titus asks Brody. He nods and signals for them to follow him. James flashes me a wide smile and I give him a large, toothy, smile. Titus wraps his hands around my waist and looks down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this why you have nightmares?&#34; He asks I lightly nod and try to look away because of how close we are. He moved one of his hands to my chin and makes me face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re mates. Don&#39;t hide from me. It&#39;s natural to want to feel the need of touch,&#34; he whispers into my ear. Shivers went down my spine and I felt a blush creep onto my cheeks. I heard a cough from the corner and I saw Jacob staring at us from his little corner. The blush grew into a deep red and I hid my face in Titus&#39; neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...I was thinking we should go hunting but, y&#39;all look busy,&#34; Jacob laughs. I groan and back away from Titus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would actually like to go hunting because of this one,&#34; I said pointing at Titus. &#34;He made my kill run away.&#34; I give a long glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great! I think I saw a few deer on my run earlier this morning,&#34; Jacob says. Titus let out a low growl at Jacob but I slapped him and narrowed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You owe this to me,&#34; I said reminding him of what he did. He let out a sigh of defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; he growled. I squealed in excitement and my wolf jumped around in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we leave now before my wolf gives me a headache?&#34; I ask them. They both nodded and I ran out the back door and jumped in the air. My wolf came out and rolled in the dirt as she landed. Titus stood in the doorway with a smile and laughed. He follows my actions and lands right next to me. Jacob comes out and closes the back door and swiftly shifts into his wolf. His wolf has a light gray with spotted ears. My wolf yipped excitement and started running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ran through the woods letting the wind pass through my fur. Her paws crush the leaves in the forest. It was getting windier and colder. It was a signal that winter was getting closer. The wind carried the scent of the deer. My wolf sped up leaving Titus and Jacob behind. She followed the scent until we came up to a few deer. My wolf grinned and snuck low behind the trees. We slowly wait for a chance to pounce. I felt a nudge on my back leg and I almost let out a growl. I look and see Titus watching us. He points his snout towards them as if he was signaling for us to kill them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spotted a fairly large female deer. He slowly crept our way towards her and she looked right at me. I let out a large animalistic growl and pounced. I land on her back and take a chunk out of her back. She let out a weird noise in pain and I fell under her. I clamped down on her back leg and she buckled from the pain. I swiftly moved out from under her before she fell on me. She quickly tried to get up so she could escape but I quickly kept her in place planting my paws on her side. I dig my canines into her neck and tear the killing chuck out. Her body relaxes and she does limp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf happily bounces off and digs into her stomach. She continues to eat but lifts her eyes and meets Titus&#39;. She ate until her stomach was full and laid down in content. She signaled for Titus and Jacob that they could finish it so they started to fill themselves up too. Titus curlers up next to me and I lay my head on his paws. He continues to lay his head on my snout. I start to drift off into a sleep but then I hear shouting a close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Titus and Jacob heads because their ears perked up at the noise. No one&#39;s supposed to be here. I get up and immediately start running towards the noise source. Titus runs faster and blocks my path. I let out a growl and he motions for me to stay behind him. I huff in aggravation and stay behind him with Jacob. We slowly walk towards the noise and I hear a familiar voice. Terry&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to break up with me here! While we have to stay for a week?&#34; I hear Kira&#39;s voice complain. So he finally got rid of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not a right fit for my Luna,&#34; he replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because of her isn&#39;t it? That slut trying to get with Alpha Titus,&#34; Terry looked furious but Titus beat him to it. He let out a loud commanding growl. He jumped up from where we were hiding and landed right in front of Kira. I swiftly jump over him and land next to Kira staring back at Titus challenging him. He growled lowly as if to say &#39;Move out my way&#39; but I stood my ground. He tries to come closer but I stomp my paw down in front of him. I let out a growl and he huffed and backed down. I let out a low growl at Kira and she looked scared. I huffed and walked away. I ran back through the forest and found clothes quickly before Titus could find me. I shifted and quickly put on the clothes. I came out from behind the tree and Titus stood there sweaty and only had shorts on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you stop me,&#34; he growled. I rolled my eyes and crossed my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to attack the possible future Luna if the Blue Crescent Wolves?&#34; I ask him raising my eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you not just hear that conversation he just broke up with her because of you,&#34; he said lifting his hands in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh so you&#39;re jealous that&#39;s why you want to attack her,&#34; I said pointing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She called you a slut you think I&#39;m going to let her talk about you like that?&#34; He said flinging his arms in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless you want to make an enemy of my pack then I recommend you don&#39;t attack their pack members,&#34; I say leaning on my left foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have no right to talk like that about you like that. And they are no longer your pack,&#34; he growls lowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I have no pack now. I&#39;m technically a rogue. Your warriors want to attack me the second they get a scent of me,&#34; I point out. His eyes began to darken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you will control your wolf right now. You can&#39;t let him get control every time you&#39;re angry,&#34; I shout at him. That sent him over the edge his canines came out and his eyes flashed golden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will not y&#39;all to me like that,&#34; he said in a commanding growl. I didn&#39;t let it affect me and I walked right up to him and got in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will control your self or I&#39;m going back to my pack with me family,&#34; I said. That made his eyes fill with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why so you can ditch me for that future Alpha pup,&#34; he shouted at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think I would leave for him! I don&#39;t want to live here where you lose control every time you&#39;re wrong,&#34; I said flinging my arms in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should have never saved you. You just turned out to be a pain in my ass,&#34; He finally said. I stopped shouting and my face went limp. It felt like I was being rejected all over again. I felt like I wasn&#39;t standing but floating on nothing. I felt my heart break and my wolf howled in pain. His eyes went back to his blue color and his face filled with regret. I backed away from him in pain. I didn&#39;t wait for him to respond. I shifted and ran. I wasn&#39;t familiar with the pack lands and it didn&#39;t feel safe to leave past the border so I ran back to the house. I shifted back and ran into my room tears running down my face. I locked the room door and collapsed on my bed. I threw clothes on and locked myself in the bathroom. My back hit the door and slid to the floor. The conversation replayed in my head over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want us.</p>
