                <p>Caius had betrayed her. But not for power.</p>

                <p>She had spent so much time hating him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to destroy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to make him suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she didn&#39;t know what the hell to do with the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of truth sinks in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ran until the scent of dust and old magic faded and the weight of the ruins was nothing but a lingering ghost at their backs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack slowed, breathing heavily, their golden eyes scanning the trees for any signs of pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Caius hadn&#39;t chased them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he hadn&#39;t needed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley knew what that meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had let her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because whatever had just happened back there whatever had awoken in those ruins</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was exactly what he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers twitched at her sides. She was still shaking, though not from exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from the fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stopped beside her, his golden gaze sharp, watchful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to talk to me,&#34; he said, voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley swallowed hard, keeping her eyes forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a lie,&#34; he said, stepping in front of her, and forcing her to meet his gaze. &#34;You saw something back there. When the ruins reacted to you. When the past tried to drag you under. You saw something, Riley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if she said it out loud, it would make it real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kieran knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena crossed her arms, watching her carefully. &#34;I swear, if you tell us &#39;you&#39;re fine,&#39; I&#39;m gonna start throwing things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t even close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because for the first time since she had stepped into this war</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was starting to wonder if she had ever really been on the right side of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack gathered in a clearing, their breath was still heavy, their bodies tense with adrenaline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some wolves sat, trying to steady themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others paced, restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of them were waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for their leader to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her to tell them what came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley could still feel the past curling around her ribs, sinking into her blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stone tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The carvings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been erased because of the war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A war that hadn&#39;t ended with her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A war that had never ended at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at them now, the wolves who had followed her through the fire, the ones who had chosen her over Tobias, the ones who had believed in her when she barely believed in herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she knew she couldn&#39;t keep the truth from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened, drawing in a slow breath, forcing herself to find the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t just erase me,&#34; she said finally, her voice even, controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the silence of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence of listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of understanding that everything was about to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled, tightening her fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They erased an entire war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley looked at him, her chest tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The fight between Tobias and me? Between Caius and me?&#34; She shook her head. &#34;It&#39;s just a piece of something bigger. Something that started long before any of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her gaze to the others, making sure they saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This war has been happening for centuries,&#34; she said. &#34;Over and over again. And every time someone gets too close to the truth they erase it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swallowed hard, the weight of it pressing down on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They thought they could erase me. That they could bury what I was, what I knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, her green eyes burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, sharp breath rippled through the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just about revenge anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just about Caius or Tobias or any of the battles they had been caught in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley was at the center of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a low whistle, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, I don&#39;t know if I should be impressed or terrified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley huffed out a breath. &#34;Both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena grinned. &#34;Good. I like a challenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kieran didn&#39;t smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were locked on Riley, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re saying we&#39;re fighting a war we can&#39;t even see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley met his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a slow step forward, letting the truth settle into her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re fighting a war they don&#39;t want us to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind shifted, carrying the distant scent of the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or rather something old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley went rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she knew that scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stiffened beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena&#39;s smirk faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the wolves tensed, ears flicking, muscles coiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure stepped out of the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone with eyes like fire and a presence that felt like death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack closed in, ready to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the figure only smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley knew this was the moment everything truly changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever this was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t here to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were here to remind her why she had been erased in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And why she would never be allowed to rise again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure took another step forward, the shadows shifting around them as if the very night itself bent to their presence. The scent they carried wasn&#39;t just wolf it was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that made the wolves behind Riley stiffen, their instincts screaming danger before the figure even spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley clenched her fists, every muscle in her body wound tight. She had faced Tobias. She had faced Caius. But this was something entirely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this wasn&#39;t an enemy from the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was an enemy from the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who had made sure she never lived long enough to finish what she started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure smiled, slow and knowing. &#34;So, it&#39;s true. You have woken up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t move. Didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from her life now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from anything she should remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ghost of something that had been stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A whisper in the back of her mind, clawing for recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind picked up, carrying their scent closer, and suddenly, Riley knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew who they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew why they were here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she knew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the one who had killed her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran shifted beside her, tense, ready. &#34;Riley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled slowly, forcing herself to speak. &#34;I know who they are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure tilted their head. &#34;Do you, now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted her chin, refusing to let the fear curl around her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one who started this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure&#39;s smile widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re the one who was never supposed to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a sharp breath, cracking her knuckles. &#34;Alright, sweetheart, I&#39;m starting to get tired of ancient people showing up and talking in riddles. Either fight us or get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure chuckled, but it wasn&#39;t warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was mocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see your new wolves are just as reckless as you were before,&#34; they mused. &#34;But you don&#39;t understand, little Alpha. I&#39;m not here to fight you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s nails bit into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure stepped forward, their golden eyes gleaming like embers in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To remind you why you lost the first time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky cracked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A force unlike anything Riley had ever felt slammed into the clearing, knocking her back, and sending the wolves staggering as the wind howled, thick with energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley hit the ground, her breath ripped from her chest, the world spinning, distorting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, trying to push herself up, but the force was everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the past itself was wrapping around her, pulling her under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They only watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they had done this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t going to let her rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not again. Not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force pressing against Riley&#39;s chest was unlike anything she had ever felt ancient, relentless, crushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the fragments she had been chasing, not the visions flashing behind her eyes in pieces she barely understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it wanted to drown her in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to move, to claw her way back to the present, but the pressure only grew stronger, wrapping around her like unseen chains, dragging her down, down, down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world split apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not through air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky above her was golden, burning. The banners that once bore her crest were in flames, ripped from the walls of a kingdom that no longer existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of wolves howling not in battle, but in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And standing before her, at the center of the chaos, was Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as he was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as the cold, unreadable man who had walked away from her in the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he had been before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate. Bloodied. Betrayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley&#34; No. That wasn&#39;t what he had called her then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t who she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Couldn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the memory wasn&#39;t finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in front of him, body shaking, blood staining her hands but not her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did this,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius flinched. &#34;I had no choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And behind him the figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who had just stepped out of the shadows in the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who had killed her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been there before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching. Controlling. Pulling the strings of a war they refused to let end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she had died for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory fractured, shattered, and snapped back into the now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley gasped, her body jolting as she slammed back into the present, the force of it nearly making her collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was already there, his hands gripping her arms, steadying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley!&#34; His voice was sharp, urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked hard, the images still seared into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one who had been there to watch her fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, they were standing in front of her again, waiting to do it all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure hadn&#39;t moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were watching her carefully like they knew exactly what she had just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like they were waiting for her to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You,&#34; she whispered, her breath shaking. &#34;You were there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure tilted their head, a slow smile creeping across their lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; they murmured. &#34;You&#39;re starting to remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp growl ripped from Kieran&#39;s chest. &#34;I don&#39;t care who you are. You need to leave. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they weren&#39;t here for Kieran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were here for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t supposed to come back,&#34; they said softly, almost regretfully. &#34;But now that you have&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled, tearing through the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the shadows at their feet began to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not anything she had ever seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that didn&#39;t belong in this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley knew this wasn&#39;t just about her past anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about the thing she had been fighting against long before she had even known it existed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time, they weren&#39;t going to let her escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadows at the figure&#39;s feet lengthened, stretched, and twisted, taking shape in ways that made Riley&#39;s stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their movements were wrong too fluid, too silent, like they weren&#39;t bound to the same rules as the rest of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they were closing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena&#39;s hands flexed at her sides, her usual smirk gone, replaced by something sharp. &#34;I don&#39;t know what the hell those things are, but I don&#39;t like them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither did Riley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she recognized them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from this life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from the memory she had just been forced to relive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the things that had been waiting in the shadows of her past, the ones that had come for her when everything had fallen apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now they are here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the war had never ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because her death hadn&#39;t been enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure sighed, almost wistful. &#34;You weren&#39;t supposed to remember them yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s teeth clenched. &#34;Too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran shifted closer to her, muscles coiled, his golden eyes locked on the creatures circling them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what those are?&#34; he asked, his voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley swallowed hard, her heart hammering. &#34;Not exactly. But I know what they do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s jaw tensed. &#34;Which is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers curled into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They erase things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air, thick and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These creatures weren&#39;t just here to kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were here to erase her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make sure she disappeared from history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make sure she never had the chance to finish what had started centuries ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure smiled. &#34;Now you see why I can&#39;t let you leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley lifted her chin, fire building in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t get to decide that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure exhaled like she had disappointed them. &#34;You always were stubborn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lifted a hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the shadows lunged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran moved first, slamming into one of the creatures before it could reach her. His claws sliced through its form, but instead of flesh, it was like striking smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thing twisted, reforming instantly, lashing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran barely dodged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena cursed. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s some supernatural bullshit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another shadow streaked toward Riley, fast and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instincts screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twisted away, bringing up her claws to strike, but the moment she touched it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimpse of herself, centuries ago, facing these same creatures in the same fight that had taken everything from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for a split second, she wasn&#39;t here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The golden throne room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The burning banners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of wolves dying, their howls mixing with the screams of something not human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius yelled her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp, cold edge of a blade pressed to her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to be you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crushing force against her chest, her body hitting the ground</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riley!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely had time to react before Kieran shoved her out of the way, claws bared as he tore into the creature that had almost reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest heaved, heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that hesitation had nearly gotten her erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved herself upright, rage slamming through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they had tried to take everything from her before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they had succeeded once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time she wasn&#39;t going to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure watched, head tilting slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still standing?&#34; they mused. &#34;Impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley wiped blood from her lip, green eyes burning. &#34;Get used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real fight began.</p>
