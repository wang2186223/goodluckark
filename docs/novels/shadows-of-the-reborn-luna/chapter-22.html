                <p>Ritual? What Ritual?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina asked herself as she peeled herself away from the study door and started to walk away quietly. She had always known that Remy was hiding something from her, but now she wondered if this was what he was hiding from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the only reason he married her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of some ritual? A ritual that he had decided and conveniently not tell her about. Just when she finally thought that they were getting along and things were going well, she was once again reminded that Remy was a powerful man, an alpha at that and he didn&#39;t marry her for love, but rather he married her for what she could do for him. It wan&#39;t clear before but it was clear now and she was disgusted and hurt by the fact that he thought he could use her that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, Valentina wasn&#39;t going to allow herself to be used, that wasn&#39;t up for debate. She was going to be a pawn in someone&#39;s game. Just an object that could be used and discarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to leave this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought came to her head and she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to have to plan her escape. She hated being holed up in the house most of the time, with nowhere to go and nothing to do. And once her memories got back and she was able to connect with her wolf, she suspected that things would be much worse. Much worse in the sense that she would be expected to participate as Luna. And even do the ritual that they had spoken of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she would not be a part of it. She would not be a part of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, jolting her out of her thoughts and she looked up to find Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said and she nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked in slowly, the tension between them as thick as the air in the room. Remy watched her closely, his eyes trying to decipher her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked and she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am. You?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You went back to that town...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started and Valentina shrugged as she ran her hand through her hair, she knew that the question was going to come up sooner or later, Remy asking her why she went back to the town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I did. Do you have a problem with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t come out in the right tone. Her tone sounded passive and aggressive, but she held her head up high and stared him down any way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I don&#39;t. I just wonder why you did, giving your history with the town. You could have gone anywhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. But that&#39;s where I wanted to go. Is there anything wrong with that?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a deep and uncomfortable silence before Remy answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. No there isn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said as he turned back and left the room, slamming the door on his way out. Valentina smirked, knowing she had him all riled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..................</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy watched the wrangler jeep pull up in the driveway and he knew that Marielle was back, he walked out to meet her and saw her hop out of the jeep, with nothing but leggings and a large black shirt and sunshades. She had a big smile on her face as she looked at Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you get my text?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he smiled wryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sure did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered as he walked closer to the jeep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only three days this time, that must be a new record for you spymaster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I aim to please. And this one was a surprisingly easy one to catch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy opened the door of the jeep and was confronted with a shaggy looking man, his hands and legs tied and his eyes blindfolded. He removed the blindfold first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh well... you didn&#39;t have to do Old John like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said sarcastically as he looked at John.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John looked just the same, except his long brown hair was spotted with grey hair and he desperately looked like he needed to shave his overgrown grey beard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dark brown beady eyes were just as Remy remembered, inquisitive and unnerving as they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John didn&#39;t say a word as he looked at his alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He hasn&#39;t said much to be honest. Don&#39;t take it the wrong way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle murmured to Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle untied the ropes while Remy stood aside, Ellen came to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that who I think it is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John&#39;s eyes only shot up when he heard the sound of Ellen&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;John?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ellen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen looked to her son for explanation and Remy gave her a small smile and a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all he said and his mother nodded in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Oh okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen said as she walked away, John&#39;s eyes followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ellen? Ellen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John called out but she ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t actually expect her to answer you do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not after everything that you&#39;ve done John. Even you don&#39;t deserve that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My only apparent crime was leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John finally said and Remy chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. At the worst fucking time too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t understand my reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John muttered again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked to the annex quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John finally cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;ve brought me here, but I will tell you that I refuse to do anything you will ask me to do until you listen to my terms and conditions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Terms and conditions?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Let&#39;s hear them then.&#34; Remy answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the annex and John was put in a room, Marielle excused herself, saying she wanted to freshen up after the long trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy watched John settle on the small bed, his eyes watching him closely. He had not seen John in years, the once revered healer of their pack, who ran away once he heard that his father the previous alpha had died. Nobody could ever decipher the motives behind his disappearance and nobody could ever figure out why he did, but there was one thing that he knew, only that their pack had lost a great and skilful healer when he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look good. Grown bigger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John commented. Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yea. Let&#39;s go straight to the point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are your terms and conditions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll let me go. I don&#39;t want to stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ouch. That hurt, but he had expected it. Remy shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody was expecting you to stay. So that&#39;s not a problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If John was surprised by Remy&#39;s answer, he didn&#39;t show it. He just nodded and looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked and John nodded as he cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will pay me for my services.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was unusual, and quite unexpected because he never thought that was what the old man would say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how much do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have to examine the patient first. See her and make an assessment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do we have a deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John asked and Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Yes we have a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina was taking a nap when she heard someone come in. She stirred in her sleep but she didn&#39;t open her eyes, thinking it was Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s voice filled the room. She nudged her gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina stretched her arms and opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry to disturb you, but you need to come downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina asked as she rubbed at her tired eyes. Marielle smiled gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, we found a local healer for you. He&#39;s part of our pack. He wants to do an assessment on you. He&#39;s down waiting for you at the annex..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat upright. Suddenly aware of Marielle&#39;s words and what they meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can he heal me? Does that mean that he can heal me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and Marielle nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s worth a try. He&#39;s a very good healer. And he&#39;s well learned. There&#39;s no one he can&#39;t heal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I believe that he&#39;d be able to heal you too. Or at least give us some insight into what&#39;s going on with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want that too right?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked softly and Valentina nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Of course I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she swung her legs out of bed. Together, they walked to the annex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy was already there, waiting for them. Their eyes met but they didn&#39;t say a word to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina looked away quickly and Remy started staring at his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go in. John&#39;s waiting. We&#39;ll be outside by the door in case you need us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, still unsure but hopeful for the best. She needed answers and if this healer man was going to provide her with answers for her past she was willing and able to do whatever was required for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that she would run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John was a slender man, he had so much hair. Long greying hair and an even longer beard. His eyes followed her as she walked into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a small smile, she didn&#39;t return the smile. She just watched him carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe he was a werewolf . He looked too fragile to be one, his hands were slender, his face was slim and his cheeks were hollow. She couldn&#39;t tell if it was as a lack of nourishment or he truly looked that thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re the Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And do you know?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Know what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know the story of the curse of the Luna of the Silverback pride?!&#34;</p>
