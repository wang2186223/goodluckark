                <p>Avoiding the sunlight, I rolled over in bed, and kicked the blanket off me, pissed over the fact that Alaska suddenly ruined breakfast this morning to inform my father that he got news about Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, dad abandoned his food and left the dining hall like that bitch was worth something to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he left the villa with Alaska, we haven&#39;t gotten any news yet, and it felt a bit odd since a couple of hours had passed already and he should have been back with his bastard by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden loud knock on my room door forced me to open my eyes, and I swear whoever was at the door, woke up and chose not to live another day because a second later, I heard, &#34;Bang! Bang!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged, I sat up, resting my back against the headboard as I turned my head to stare at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?&#34; I shouted, feeling hesitant to leave the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me, James. Milady, Our Luna requested your presence in the dining room,&#34; James&#39; voice echoed into my bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are summoned to have lunch with her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time had flown by way faster than I realized, and even though I wasn&#39;t in the mood for food, I forced myself to leave my bed and walked towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I stepped out of my room, James hastily bowed his head, and I scowled at him before walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached the dinner hall, Mother was standing beside father&#39;s seat with her fingertips tracing against its wooden frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Are you thinking about snatching it from him?&#34; I mumbled, drawing a seat out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I sat down and watched a frown cross her face as she stepped away from father&#39;s chair and said, &#34;Of course, not. What&#39;s the use of doing so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk curved on my lips as I gazed down at my steak and then picked up my fork and knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wolf hasn&#39;t become attracted to anyone yet?&#34; Mother suddenly asked, and I immediately dropped my utensils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I glared at her, and she harshly uttered, &#34;Why are you staring at me like that. If you want to have a strong standing within this pack and prove your worth, you need a powerful alpha as your back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was! The one thing that makes me a bit similar to my half-sister! I haven&#39;t found my soulmate, yet, and the pressure my mother put on me to do so is irritating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she&#39;s right, as an omega, I will need an alpha, if I want to take over the pack one day since my mother couldn&#39;t bear my father an alpha son as he ordered her to do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, mother,&#34; I mumbled, losing my appetite completely. Then I slightly pushed the plate away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gazing into my eyes, my mother didn&#39;t speak for a moment, and then she said, &#34;Karen&#39;s brother is an Alpha wolf. Maybe it&#39;s time that you two meet and see if your wolves agree with each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a dick, mother!&#34; I blurted out in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Language, Luna!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry to say, but Killian is an as donkey. And&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not a plea, Luna! It&#39;s an order!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, I was about to get paired with the worst douchebag ever. Sure, his wolf is crazy powerful. But he has been fucking human prostitutes and slaves in the pack for years because he thinks it&#39;s funny and entertaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is no way my wolf would want to bond with that piece of shit. But for now, I will allow my mother to get what she wants until I see someone compatible with my wolf and statues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not going to eat?&#34; Mother said, giving me a warning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I didn&#39;t want to pick up those damn utensils again. But mother&#39;s patience wasn&#39;t something to test. So I picked up the fork and in that instant, my mother mumbled, &#34;Your father is home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, my mother stood to her feet, and I did the same after picking up his scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of us rushed upstairs, following my father&#39;s scent, and then we walked into his and my mother&#39;s bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quietness in the room suddenly ended when a vase smashed into the dresser mirror, shattering it into pieces instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of great bitterness swept across my father&#39;s face, and with a murderous gaze, he balled his fingers into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As the alpha of this pack, a behavior like this is going to make your inferiors think you are weak,&#34; my mother calmly intoned as she walked further inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I stayed close by the door because my father&#39;s temper could escalate anytime and it was best for me that my mother was the one in front of him when it happens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think me getting angry over that brat leaving the pack is a sign of weakness!&#34; My father harshly said, swaying his gaze on my mother as she stopped in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, so many things I anticipated would happen when Blake gets found. But her banishing herself from the park was never one of them, and it messed with my mind for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake did what!?&#34; My mother harshly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess she too was just as shocked as me that Blake chose to execute herself in such a manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She forced me to denounce her in front of her entire class.&#34; My father said, sounding more enraged with every word he uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that Blake was bold, a bit too bold for her own good. But this was not bold act! It was pure, undeniable stupidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping a blank expression on my face, my heart leaped for joy as I softly asked, &#34;So, is she now a rogue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what she wants!&#34; My father harshly said. &#34;She doesn&#39;t even know what she is getting herself into!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, my mother calmly stared at him. Then she walked over to his back, rested her palms on his shoulders, and gently massaged them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you going to call a pack meeting?&#34; My mother whispered into his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, my father pulled away from her, and then glared at her before coldly uttering, &#34;Why should I call a pack meeting, Loretta!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To officially denounce Blake, of course!&#34; My mother said and I heard no remorse in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, my father took a long look at her with anger glowing in his eyes. Then he unclenched his fists and coldly uttered, &#34;You know what happens to the rogue of this pack, and you want me to do what?! Do you want me to sentence my daughter to death!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have already done it when you told all her classmates that she&#39;s not your daughter or a member of the pack. Words spread like the wind, and soon, everyone will know. Withdrawing your words now will make you look like a weak alpha.&#34; My mother firmly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked at my father, I could see in his eyes that he was hesitant, and it had me questioning if he was going to do it or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A familiar and strange scent</p>
                
                
                
                <p>********Blake POV**********</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the supermarket from a distance, I busily tapped Nero on his shoulder and shouted, &#34;Can you stop at &#39;Greenland?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Nero shouted back, glaring at me for a second as though he was annoyed that I was distracting him from focusing on driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying the reason out loud in my head sounded a bit embarrassing. So I chewed on my bottom lip, darted my eyes away from him, and then mumbled, &#34;Forget it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing, Nero suddenly made a U-turn and drove into the parking lot of the supermarket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he stepped on the brake before looking at me and blurting out, &#34;Are you in need of Sanitary pads or something!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I wanted to chuckle, I suppressed my laugh and didn&#39;t look at him because from his voice I could tell that he was upset with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that is not what I need,&#34; I mumbled, screwing my face into a frown. &#34;You know what, let&#39;s just forget about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, what do you want?&#34; Nero asked a bit calmer this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating for a moment, I swayed my gaze toward him, looked into his eyes, and said, &#34;Groceries. I thought it would be nice to make dinner tonight as a way to say, &#39;thank you, for allowing me to stay with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word to me, Nero drew a deep breath. Then he sighed and said, &#34;Give me your list, and I will get them for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I hate to admit it, I can see why my wolf is attached to him. He can be a nice guy when he isn&#39;t being an ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a second, I quickly unzipped my bag and took out my notebook and pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I intensely gazed at him and asked, &#34;Alright, are you allergic to anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Nero calmly uttered. &#34;Can you hurry this up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pouting, I lowered my brows, opened my notebook, and started writing into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of minutes had gone by, I handed him a piece of paper, and for a moment, Nero blankly stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he took it out of my hand, looked at me for a second before staring at the paper and reading out loud, &#34;Beef tenderloin, Salt and pepper, Olive oil, Onion, Garlic, Prosciutto, Yellow mustard, Puff pastry sheet, Eggs, spice&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you wanted to get done with this, so why are you reading the list instead of getting them!&#34; I muttered, feeling a bit ruffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to do with all these?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cook dinner!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look of doubt in his eyes, Nero frowned and said, &#34;Do not make me waste my money, and you end up dirtying my kitchen just to make something awful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! You don&#39;t think that I can cook!&#34; I lashed out. &#34;Well, you will be surprised to know that I have been in the kitchen since I can remember! I had to if I wanted to have something in my belly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere grew quiet as Nero&#39;s expression softened. Then he unlocked the door and got out of the car without saying another word to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of minutes went by after I watched Nero walk into the supermarket, and when I started to feel a bit aggravated that he wasn&#39;t back yet, he suddenly walked out of the building with four plastic bags in both of his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he approached the car, I recognize the scent of a group of students from my school nearby, and Karen&#39;s note instantly crossed my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I squeezed myself down on the car floor and pressed my forehead against my kneecap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then this unexpected rushed of dominant force took over me, and I instantly lost custody of my body, and my wolf took over, and all I could do was let it happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a slip second, my scent faded, and I finally realized that she was trying to protect not me but Nero since if any one of them pick up my scent in his car, we will both get into some deep shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds of silence, I heard Jimmy Carter&#39;s voice, &#34;Hey, Mr. Fang. Do you need help with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then shortly after, Nero shouted back, &#34;Hi, Jimmy! It&#39;s fine! What wolf will I be if I can&#39;t carry four bags of groceries! Thank you for offering though!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, tomorrow then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! See you in class tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, the back door suddenly opened, and then Neron sat the bags on the seat. As he was about to close the door, he frowned as he stared at me squatting on the car floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped his lips and he slammed the door shut. Then a minute later, he got behind the steering wheel and mumbled, &#34; They are gone. You can get up now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, I woke from the floor and sat back on the seat, tugging a few loose strings of my hair behind my ear with my gaze focused on the tinted windshield as I tried to pretend that I didn&#39;t feel embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, Nero continued staring at me even though I refused to meet his gaze. Then he finally said, &#34;You can mask your scent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, my wolf does it,&#34; I mumbled. &#34;She takes control whenever she wants and does whatever she wants with my body, and I don&#39;t have the slightest control of any of the things she does, even though I&#39;m in the know about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car grew silent for a moment, Without saying a word, he leaned over towards me, and rested his palm flat on her thigh while reaching on the car floor with his other hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I mumbled when his hand stroked against my jeans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Getting this,&#34; Nero said as he raised his head and gazed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my eyes were directed to where his hands were, and he followed my gaze, looking at his hand, pressed against my thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My bad,&#34; Nero said, hastily pulling his hand back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sitting straight in his seat, he unfolded the piece of paper and silently read it, &#34;I know that you left the campus in Mr. Fang&#39;s car, and if you don&#39;t want him to get into trouble, you will keep your hole shut!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stupid piece of paper must have dropped from my bag when I was taking out my notebook and I didn&#39;t even know it did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this why you lied about staying at a motel to your father?&#34; Nero asked, looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I mumbled, striving to calm down my pounding heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I took the paper out of Nero&#39;s hand and looked at it for a moment before tearing it up into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kind of, and it&#39;s also because my dad is a crazy maniac who would have hurt you pretty badly or worst, kill you if he knew that you helped me disobey him. I learn from past mistakes.&#34; I said, feeling a knot in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of us didn&#39;t speak for a while as Nero continue to gaze at me. Then he suddenly looked away, started the car engine, and drove out of the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the ride to the mansion was filled with awkward silence, and when Nero and I finally walked into the hallway of his home, I felt like I could finally breathe freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go upstairs and freshen up. I will take these to the kitchen.&#34; Nero said as he stared my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding slightly, I gave him a faint smile. Then I rushed upstairs, trying to escape the awkwardness between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to Nero&#39;s room, I shut the door, rested back on its wooden surface, and thought, &#39;Am I being too open about my life with him?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I slid down to the floor, brought my knees towards my chest, and cried in my head, &#39;Of course, he&#39;s uncomfortable with me. Anyone would be if they hear about my life &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But those thoughts quickly vanished from my mind because being in his bedroom again felt like walking back to the scene of a crime that I committed, and it took only a second for memories to disrupt my mind and keep me hostile in my feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room had his smell, and when I gazed at the bedsheet, flashes of images took over my mind, and I lost myself in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body immediately started to feel excited and I felt a bit wet between my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An omega heat lasts for four to seven days. That&#39;s what Nero said, and now, thinking about it, I realized that being in a house full of an alpha scent wasn&#39;t the best for me at such a moment, especially since that alpha has rejected me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a moment to think, I walked away from the door, ignoring the heat I felt, and dropped my bag on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I headed into the bathroom, got undressed, and stepped into the shower, allowing the warm water to beat upon my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I closed my eyes, feeling the wetness of the water washing against my body, my mind tortured me with memories of Nero&#39;s touch, the way his hands caressed against my clitoris and nipple, and the sound of his voice, and immediately, I opened my eyes, drawing a long, deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is bad,&#34; I whispered, resting my head against the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the shower a while later, I walked back into Nero&#39;s room, took a moment to dry my hair, got dressed into a black comfy t-shirt of his, and sluggishly sat on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I picked up a scent other than Nero&#39;s. It was a familiar scent, even though I didn&#39;t know who it belonged to, and knowing that a strange wolf had entered the house made me feel a bit uneasy, and I could sense my wolf getting alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is it lust or something else</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***************Nero Pov************</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked past the living room, I screwed my face into a frown when Jason suddenly sped from behind me, crossed in front of me, and stepped in my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go upstairs and freshen up. I will take these to the kitchen! Seriously! What the hell happened last night to get you two acting like mates?&#34; Jason lashed out, frowning as I walked past him with the bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he kept walking behind me until we got into the kitchen and stopped in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you mark her?!&#34; Jason blurted out. &#34;Or did you fuc&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I sluggishly dropped the bags on the counter, turned around to stare at my beta, and said, &#34;No, Jason, I didn&#39;t mark her, neither did I mate with her. She simply needs a place to stay for two weeks&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two weeks! You are allowing Hayes&#39;s daughter to stay here for two weeks! What is wrong with you!&#34; Jason lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden sense of rage stirred up in me and my wolf awakened, and immediately, Jason sealed his lip, lowering his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not Hayes&#39;s daughter anymore,&#34; I said, signing heavily as I restrained my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Jason blurted out, looking at me with wide eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He denounced her today. That&#39;s why she needs a place to stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, she&#39;s a rogue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the frown on Jason&#39;s face, I furrowed my brows and mumbled, &#34;Yes. So for two weeks, she is going to be staying here. If you don&#39;t like it, then find yourself a hotel to stay in until the time is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are kicking me out because of her!?&#34; Jason asked, crossing his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m asking you to spare me the drama and leave for my peace of mind if you are not going to get along with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have known me from the time we were young cubs! How long have you known her for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vortex of energy swirled inside me as I roared, &#34;What do you want me to do, Jason! Toss a nineteen years old wolf on the street and leave her to get brutally killed by her pack?! Huh! Is that what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitchen suddenly fell silent when Blake stopped at the entrance and gazed at Jason before staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Jason glared at Blake. Then he suddenly growled at her as his eyes shifted yellow and shouted, &#34;Take off his clothes, you filthy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, back off and stop!&#34; I commended, meeting his icy gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause. Then Jason shoved his hand into his jacket pocket and walked past Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?!&#34; I yelled after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To book a hotel room!&#34; Jason coldly uttered as his footsteps faded down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the front door slammed shut, Blake&#39;s eyes flinched, and I could tell that she was holding back her breath as she looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in the kitchen lasted for a while. Then I said, &#34;I will leave you to do your cooking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, Blake darted her eyes away from me as she walked into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to step past her, she grabbed my hand and mumbled beneath her breath, &#34;Do you still have an appetite to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, no I don&#39;t,&#34; I said, looking down at her fingers wrapped around my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a deep breath, Blake slowly let go of my wrist and mumbled, &#34;Me too,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked at her and furrowed my brows, Blake forced a smile and said, &#34;I should put the groceries away before they spoil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not waiting for a response from me, she walked into the living room and headed to the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she started unpacking the things from the bag while trying not to gaze at me even though I was intensely staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about Jason. He will come around.&#34; I finally said, leaning against the doorway frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; Blake mumbled with her gaze still fixed on the bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew quiet as I watched her carry the meat to the refrigerator. Then I hesitated for a moment before saying, &#34;He&#39;s just a bit overprotective of me because I&#39;m all that he has.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bit!? He growled at me, Nero!&#34; Blake lashed out. &#34;And I didn&#39;t even do a thing to him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True. You did nothing to him, but your pack did. Grudge from past trauma can be passed on from generation to generation of the offender, and even the innocent ones connected to them suddenly become a villain in the victim&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After stuffing the things into the refrigerator, Blake looked at me with anger glowing in her eyes as though she was waiting for me to give her a better excuse for Jason&#39;s behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t speak, she walked out of the kitchen, leaving me staring after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the truth was, it was something that I couldn&#39;t tell her, not now, not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it now, maybe it&#39;s the reason I feel so sympathetic towards her because I regret some of what I did in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I heard Blake slam my room door shut, I sighed and headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived in the guest room, I went into the bathroom, stripped, and hit the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long bath, I came back to my room, wearing only a towel around my waist, and headed to the closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I had gotten my hands on some clean t-shirt and sweatpants, I tossed the wet towel on the chair and got dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I crawled into my bed and shut my eyes, giving in to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strong scent of pheromones forced me to raise my eyelids, and I reached for my phone on the bed stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned the screen on, I realized that it was twelve o&#39;clock, already morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying wide awake in bed, I darted my eyes around the room before rubbing my palm against my face and letting out a yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, I ignored all Blake&#39;s pheromones, but it was only getting stronger with every passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was I thinking, letting an amateur omega into my house when she&#39;s going through her first heat and transformation, especially when she doesn&#39;t have control over her wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent was driving me nuts, and at first, I tried so desperately to ignore it. But as it grew stronger, I felt like I was about to lose my damn mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I knew what that scent meant, I also knew that there was nothing I could do about it and that frustrated me even more, sending my anger off the chart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; I mumbled, getting out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I left the guest room, walked down the hallway for a while before stopping at my bedroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, are you okay?&#34; I asked, gently knocking its wooden frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of minutes went by in silence. Then I heard her soft voice, &#34;No,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounds so seductive that I had an erection. But I suppressed it all in and asked, &#34;What are you doing to help relieve yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long pause before she whispered, &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pheromones were getting so damn stronger, and I knew that I couldn&#39;t step into that room or else I would go insane and have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you touch yourself?&#34; I asked, rubbing my brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Blake said, sounding confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I sighed at how naive she was and asked, &#34;Do you masturbate, Blake?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; Blake muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I rested my palm over my face and said, &#34;Inhale my shirt while doing it. It will help you calm down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But Your scent is not strong on your shirt. So can you stay at the door?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But with you nearby, it&#39;s way more helpful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the thought of what I was about to agree to was annoying me, and yet, I said, &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was silent for a while, then I heard her soft moan, &#34;Aah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squeezing my eyes shut, I let out a deep breath when she shrieked, &#34;Mmmmh!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my back rested against the door as I laid my head against it, caging my wolf with all my strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aah aah!!&#34; Blake screamed, and I drew in another deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she let out an, &#34;ahhh!&#34; almost in a screeching scream, and I slowly inhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was pure torture, and I tried my best not to imagine what she was doing to herself in that room to make her make all those noises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, her voice trailed off and faded after a couple of minutes had passed, and she became quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; I called out, wondering if she had fallen asleep after a few seconds had gone by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t answer, I walked away from the door, headed back to the guest room, and locked the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I aggressively ripped my shirt off my body and headed into the bathroom to cool off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the water pulled from the shower with force, beating upon my skin, I rested my head against the glass, moving my hand in an up-and-down motion on my phallus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I held it against my stomach and stroked the underside of my shaft quickly with my non-dominant hand, trying to relieve myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never have an omega or anyone made me do this to myself, and as I let out a soft growl, I wondered if I was at the edge of breaking a curse, or if it was just pure lust that I felt for Blake.</p>
