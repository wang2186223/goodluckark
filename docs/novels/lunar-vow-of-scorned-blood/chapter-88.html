                <p>&#34;But we really have to go now! Belerick will be here any minute now!&#34; Belerick? Again another unfamiliar name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who are this people? And why are they calling me a different name. I wanted to tell them that my name was not Aiden but I couldn&#39;t even utter a word, it was like my mouth had a mind of its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes and I was still in the clinic. What was that dream again. My head was still hurting, I don&#39;t if it was because I was sleeping for quite long or because of my weird dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Doctor entered the clinic and dead some check on my wounds then change the bandages before I was allowed to go back to the packhouse. When I got there, Dad was busy talking to some of the pack members, I didn&#39;t hear what they were talking about before I entered but it does look serious, when he finally saw me. He pat my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling?&#34; He ask, while checking at my overall appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine Dad, when will the challenge continue?&#34; I ask, he then shake his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be no further challenge, the pack members did had a petition to let you go back to being an Alpha. After what happened last night they saw how you want to prove yourself to them especially after you caught one of the Royalties who betrayed us.&#34; I wanted to say that I didn&#39;t caught him exactly, he surrender himself on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The announcement of your return will be tonight. Now I expect you to not let anything happened like before. They did doubted your capabilities as an Alpha after everything that happened before but last night you showed them the power of a true Alpha. And to be honest even myself cannot stand with that state of yours last night.&#34; He added, I couldn&#39;t even say anything. I know this is all I wanted in the first place but why do I feel like I wasn&#39;t happy at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our talk I went to my room to rest for a while, I heard that Sarah went for a hunt in the forest while Alec already got out of the clinic before I did. I didn&#39;t even notice that he was actually there. The funeral for the participants who died during the challenge was already been burned, that is what we usually do to the pack members who died. It was like we are returning them back to the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still haven&#39;t heard anything about Clint or where did they take him. But what I know is Hunter is up to something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock from the door pulled me out of my bed. And when I opened it. Kyler was standing there waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon Alpha.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; He shrugged his shoulders. He reminded me of Zion but their only difference is Zion was the strict one while Tyler was a bit of a happy go lucky kind of guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to report that I would be your next Beta, Alpha. Even though it was still unofficial until tonight.&#34; I wasn&#39;t surprised to hear that from him. After witnessing how he fight last night he was really the fitted one to be the new Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of what I did to Zion last night creep me out. I don&#39;t know why I was suddenly in rage when I first saw him and before I knew it I was almost killing him. And to be honest I was glad that Clint got there in time before I could kill my own best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem? Are you okay?&#34; I shake my head, not even noticing that I was lost in my thoughts in front of Kyler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m fine. I was just thinking about last night.&#34; Just like me Kyler was also covered in bandages but unlike me I can&#39;t still walk properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then I just want to let you know that, and I will see you tonight Alpha.&#34; He bowed his head and then left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I am really back as an Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That even just like what they said the pack was gathered back in the open field. My father was already up in the stage that they made. He was with my mother, they are holding each other&#39;s hand while Sarah was next to them along side Hunter and Kyler. After our fight last night I still haven&#39;t caught a glimpse of Alec, not that I wanted to see him but I don&#39;t know something is telling me that I need to talk to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I climbed the stage the crowd started cheering for me. Calling my name and other things. I didn&#39;t expect that after last night they would suddenly change like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening everyone. I know all of you have witnessed the battle last night, unfortunately we did lost some of our pack members, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they life was wasted. They proved that they are really one of our pack, a pack that do not know how to give up. And for those pack members who did choice to give up their seat for the Alpha title, you all still showed that you still aren&#39;t ready to take the responsibility but that doesn&#39;t mean you are all weak or a bunch of cowards. There are still time to improve and that is what is important.&#34; My father said, everyone agreed and I glance at the direction of the participants who gave up, some of them looked embarrassed while some looks like my father&#39;s words inspired them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, I would like you all to great back your Alpha.&#34; He then let me go in front. I don&#39;t like this kind of things to be honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hunter was completely quiet the whole time, after the announcement, which includes the new Beta Kyler. Who looked proud of himself. I just thank everyone for letting me be their Alpha again. As I was about to step out of the stage Hunter step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is still an additional announcement everyone. Another member of our pack is about to come.&#34; I stood there unsure what he was talking about. My father did have the same look as I did. While my mother was smiling, does she knows something I don&#39;t?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you are all aware of, our dearest Sarah here who is the mate of our Alpha, my great-great grandson was actually having his child.&#34; Everyone became completely quiet, including me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah stood there with tears in her eyes, while she smile. She then turned her head to me before she pulled me into a tight hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are going to be a father Dwayne.&#34; She mumbled, and with that the crowd became loud again. I don&#39;t even know how to feel, I stood there completely dumbfounded. Sarah was still in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stroke her hair, then my mother squeal when Sarah pull away, and this time it was her who hugged Sarah then me. My father then congratulate Sarah and me about the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t believe what I just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like the marking ceremony still need to wait after Sarah gave birth.&#34; My father said, well pregnant werewolf were not allowed to received a marking from their mates because it can harm the baby, which can lead for the death of the baby in their womb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; I answered shortly. Sarah was clinging on my arms while the pack members congratulate us one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like the pack will have their heir soon.&#34; Kyler mumbled, then shake my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, this is a really great news.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much, I couldn&#39;t even believe it myself after the Doctor said I was actually pregnant.&#34; Sarah answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be really happy right now Alpha.&#34; I couldn&#39;t even agreed to what he said. Happy? Is something that I wasn&#39;t feeling right now. I was more on surprised than being happy. I know it was rude and not right for me to feel this way especially towards the announcement of my unborn child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dwayne? Are you okay?&#34; Sarah shake me out of my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I think, I was still in shocked after hearing that I would have a child soon.&#34; I muttered, Sarah then stared at me like she was actually touch that I felt that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was also like that when I heard the news that I was pregnant.&#34; She mumbled, touching my chest as she leans her head on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I totally understand how you felt, I was also like that when I heard that my mate was going to give birth of my child.&#34; Kyler said, making me surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a mate? And a child?&#34; He chuckled at my reaction then nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I met her last year. She was from the South Lake Pack, but because the law state that a female werewolf should follow her mate no matter which pack he belongs to. And she gave birth to our first child last month.&#34; He mumbled, which surprised me. He was still young but knowing werewolves can&#39;t stop themselves from marking their mates after meeting them so it wasn&#39;t something uncommon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was really great! I hope to meet your mate soon.&#34; Sarah uttered, then they both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will meet her soon, she was still back in the south to visit her family with our child. She will be here by tomorrow.&#34; He mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then I will leave the two of you alone. I&#39;m sure you still have something to talk about.&#34; Kyler then wink at me before making his way back to the other pack members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you say anything to me?&#34; I ask, Sarah as soon as he left. I also made sure no one is close enough to hear us talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It all happened so quickly, and that time you have your fight to win the Alpha title back. And Hunter did say that I should keep it quiet until you are done.&#34; She explains, then her expression changes into displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you perhaps not happy that I was pregnant with your child?!&#34; She mumbled, her eyes was starting to become teary and I couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! I was just surprised that you told the other people first before me.&#34; I mumbled, then pulled her in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was really happy Sarah. You don&#39;t know how happy I am that I would be a father soon.&#34; I mumbled, but I know deep inside my feelings are the irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking those thoughts away, I held my hand on her tummy, soon it will start to grow, creating a small bump where my child would soon grow up soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Sarah asked, she still not quite believe me. I smiled at her and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really.&#34; I mumbled, she smiled as soon as I said that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone cleared his throat behind me and there he was standing while staring at us with amused face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to congratulate again my soon to be great-great granddaughter.&#34; Sarah pulled away from me and hugged Hunter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And to you Dwayne, I could never be more happier after hearing that you will soon have your child.&#34; He said, I just scratch the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that the reason why you keep it a secret to me?&#34; I couldn&#39;t hide the bitterness in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not, we just want to surprise you especially after you are back as an Alpha. And this child of yours will soon inherit your title.&#34; He stroke Sarah&#39;s tummy which is still not even noticeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was just jealous that he did not heard the news first.&#34; My mother appear out of nowhere and budge in the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hunter then chuckled at my mother&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, is that so? The same reaction as his father.&#34; He mumbled then my father did come out of the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t act like that.&#34; My father said in his defense. My mother started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course you are my dear! Remember the time when I announce the pregnancy in front of the whole pack and what you did was carry me all the way to the stage and ask me if it was all true. And when I said yes, you just became silent the whole time and said out of nowhere that why didn&#39;t I said it to you first.&#34; My mother said, recalling some of their memories together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember doing that.&#34; He said, then my mother just shakes her head because of his stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You both are really alike.&#34; She mumbles, staring at my father then back to me before shaking her head again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah just giggle at my father and mother&#39;s exchange while Hunter joined them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did remember that time, he was even so worried during the time you gave birth to Dwayne that he almost choke the Doctor for not letting you get out of your mother.&#34; Hunter said, and my father just look like his regular self. He was turning red because of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I remember that, then when Dwayne finally got birth he almost fainted and when he first held him, his hands are shaking.&#34; Mom said, still laughing at my Dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder if I could feel the same thing as my parents when my child was born. I glance at Sarah then down to her tummy. Soon enough her tummy will start to grow just like the life in her womb. Will I also choke a Doctor for not letting my child gave birth soon, will I be so nervous that would lead for me to start trembling upon seeing my baby?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah then notice my stare and she walks towards me. I held her waist as we both watch my father and mother recall their unforgettable moment of my birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if we will be just like that when it was our child&#39;s time to have a child?&#34; She mumbled, having the same thoughts as I do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are probably worse than then.&#34; I said, and she laugh at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are definitely right about that. I would probably end up being steric after realizing that kur child will come out soon.&#34; She mumbled, I nodded my head in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I would be carrying you to the Doctor, who I would probably gonna choke until he fainted. &#34; I uttered, just imagining it made me laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both started laughing, and my mother, Hunter, and my father then stared at the both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You both are really perfect together.&#34; My mother said, my father remained silent and didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well let&#39;s leave them be, we are just disturbing them and right now they both need to rest.&#34; Hunter said, my mom hugged both Sarah and I before leaving us alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the kind of picture that I always wish for, the pack members are eating while other are drinking and talking to each other, the childrens are running around playing to each other. While some are sitting next to the bonfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is really great.&#34; Sarah mumbled, and I couldn&#39;t disagree with her. The lack really look peaceful right now. Like everything was completely normal like how it was before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only if the Royalties and those Rogues didn&#39;t disturb our peace then perhaps everything will be like this everyday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at Sarah and she was staring back at me, leaning closer as she close her eyes. I then lead to her and kissed her. It was the right thing to fo right now but it felt wrong at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I pulled away, a pair of eyes staring back at me in the far dark corner of the woods. I couldn&#39;t be wrong I did see someone standing there a few minutes ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah notice my reaction and turn around to see what I am looking at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; She ask, I shake my head. Am I seeing things again? Was that my imagination again? But why does it felt so real? And I swear I could feel the chills run down my body as that person stared at us? Or at me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, I just thought I saw something.&#34; I mumbled, shaking my head. Then held Sarah back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? You don&#39;t look good right now. Your complexion suddenly look like you&#39;ve seen a goes or something.&#34; She mumbled, again I shake my head and kissed her once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay, I was probably just tired.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it was still too early to leave the celebration, and everyone prepared this for us.&#34; I added, which bring back her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right about that, we should enjoy this evening and not let anything ruined it for us.&#34; She then pulled me to the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before that I glance once more in the woods, woods where I saw those pair of blue-gray eyes staring at me. But just like before no one is there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am really going crazy.</p>
