                <p>Arin closed her eyes, breathing deeply. The air in the shop grew heavy, charged with electricity. Sophia felt her own dormant magic responding, scales rippling beneath the surface of her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gesture of her hands, Arin began to weave her spell. Water vapor condensed from the air, forming swirling patterns that glowed with bioluminescence. The droplets merged into a sphere hovering between her palms, growing larger and more complex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the sphere, images formed - the underwater city of Aquaria, the coral palace, and then, to Sophia&#39;s surprise, a vision of the ancient city Tharros had discovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lumaria,&#34; Marcus whispered, his face bathed in the blue glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s magic intensified. The water sphere expanded, filling the shop with projected images of ancient symbols and glowing runes. But as the spell grew stronger, something unexpected happened. Dark patterns - intricate spirals and jagged shapes - began forming within the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia recognized that darkness. It was the same magic she&#39;d glimpsed when Arin had fought off the shark attackers months ago. Magic she wasn&#39;t supposed to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus gasped, pointing to a particular symbol that pulsed at the center of the spell. &#34;The Mark of the Abyss! I knew it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s concentration broke, and the watery vision collapsed, splashing to the floor and vanishing in wisps of steam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Satisfied?&#34; she asked, her voice strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39;s expression had changed from curiosity to reverence. He pulled back his sleeve, revealing a tattoo on his forearm - the same spiral symbol that had appeared in Arin&#39;s magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My family has guarded the secrets of the sea people for fifteen generations,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;We&#39;ve been waiting for this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried to a bookshelf, pulling out volumes until something clicked. The shelf swung outward, revealing a hidden alcove containing a single item - a rolled parchment sealed with black wax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Temple of the Tides,&#34; he said, carefully breaking the seal. &#34;Hidden in the coastal cliffs ten miles north of here. The entrance appears only during the lowest tide of the year.&#34; He checked his watch. &#34;Which happens to be tonight, just after midnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia studied the map he unrolled. &#34;This is a keystone location?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of three on land,&#34; Marcus confirmed. &#34;My ancestors helped hide it after the Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you helping us?&#34; Arin asked suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Collector&#39;s face turned grim. &#34;Because I&#39;ve seen the signs too. The purple storms at sea. The strange creatures washing ashore. The Division is failing, just as the prophecies said it would.&#34; He fixed his gaze on Sophia. &#34;And you, dragon&#39;s mate, are at the center of it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden tremor shook the shop, rattling display cases and sending several artifacts crashing to the floor. Outside, people shouted in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia rushed to the window. In the bay, the water had pulled back impossibly far, exposing the seabed. The purple whirlpool had grown, now visible even from shore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s starting,&#34; Marcus whispered. &#34;The convergence of realms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go,&#34; Sophia said, grabbing the map. &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they hurried to the door, Marcus called after them. &#34;Sea witch!&#34; When Arin turned, he tossed her a small object - a coral pendant carved with the spiral symbol. &#34;For protection. You&#39;ll need it where you&#39;re going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the car, Sophia studied the map while Arin drove north along the increasingly deserted highway. The tremors continued, stronger each time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that symbol he recognized?&#34; Sophia asked. &#34;The Mark of the Abyss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s hands tightened on the wheel. &#34;A story for another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No more secrets, Arin. Not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sea witch sighed. &#34;It&#39;s the mark of those who draw power directly from the deep trenches. Magic considered forbidden even in Aquaria.&#34; She glanced at Sophia. &#34;Magic I wasn&#39;t supposed to have access to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could respond, her phone chimed with an emergency alert. She read it aloud: &#34;Tsunami warning for all coastal areas. Immediate evacuation advised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They crested a hill, and the sight before them made them both gasp. The ocean had withdrawn at least a mile from shore, exposing shipwrecks and underwater caves never seen by human eyes. The sky above had turned an unnatural shade of purple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of the exposed seabed, a massive whirlpool of dark energy churned, and rising from its depths was a structure of crystal and strange metal - a tower identical to the one Tharros had described.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Temple of the Tides,&#34; Arin whispered. &#34;It&#39;s not in the cliffs. It&#39;s there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt a faint tug in her mind - the bond with Tharros flickering back to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re alive,&#34; she said, hope surging through her. &#34;But something&#39;s wrong. They&#39;re... changed somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if in response, the tower pulsed with blinding light. When Sophia could see again, she spotted two figures standing at its base.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from this distance, she recognized Tharros and Kael. But they weren&#39;t alone. Behind them, hundreds of translucent guardians rose from the exposed seabed, their eyes glowing red in the gathering darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And standing before them all was a massive figure whose form shifted constantly between human and something else entirely - something ancient and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Keeper,&#34; Arin whispered, her face draining of color. &#34;The Division has already fallen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Royal Blood</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to them?&#34; Sophia whispered, gripping the guard rail along the cliff edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far below, Tharros and Kael seemed frozen in place at the base of the crystal tower, surrounded by the strange guardians. The massive figure of the Keeper loomed behind them, its shifting form casting strange shadows across the exposed seabed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin raised a hand, green magic dancing between her fingers as she tried to sense what was happening. &#34;They&#39;re not themselves. It&#39;s like they&#39;re... waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For us,&#34; Arin said grimly. &#34;The Keeper has them in some kind of trance. It wants all four of us together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pendant Marcus had given Arin began to glow, pulsing in rhythm with the tower. She studied it, frowning. &#34;This isn&#39;t just a protection charm. It&#39;s a key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another tremor shook the ground, stronger than before. The road behind them cracked, a jagged line splitting the asphalt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t just stand here,&#34; Sophia said, the emptiness in her mind where her connection to Tharros should be aching like a phantom limb. &#34;We have to get down there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin pointed to a narrow path winding down the cliff face. &#34;That way. But be careful-the Keeper will sense us coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they picked their way down the treacherous path, Sophia felt the strange energy from the exposed sea floor washing over her in waves. With each step, the dormant scales beneath her skin prickled and shifted, responding to the ancient magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s not right,&#34; she said, pausing to catch her breath. &#34;This feels like the magic from the Division, but... different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not just ending,&#34; Arin replied, her eyes fixed on the tower. &#34;It&#39;s being rewritten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally reached the bottom, the exposed seabed felt alien beneath their feet-a landscape of strange formations and glittering minerals never meant to be seen by surface dwellers. The air hung heavy with salt and electricity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached the tower, Sophia could make out more details. Tharros and Kael stood perfectly still, their eyes open but vacant, fixed on the massive doors of the structure. Their skin glowed with faint blue markings-the same symbols she had seen in the memory vault&#39;s visions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Keeper noticed them first. Its massive form shifted, becoming more solid as it turned toward them. When it spoke, its voice bypassed their ears and echoed directly in their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The four pieces gather. The cycle continues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros and Kael suddenly jerked to life, turning in perfect unison. Their movements were stiff, mechanical, nothing like their usual grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia,&#34; Tharros said, but his voice sounded hollow. &#34;You came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s silver eyes flashed, a brief moment of recognition breaking through whatever held him. &#34;It&#39;s a trap,&#34; he managed to say before his expression went blank again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Keeper raised a massive hand, and the tower doors swung open with a grinding sound that shook the ground beneath their feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enter,&#34; it commanded. &#34;The Division falters. The truth awaits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt an invisible force pulling her forward. Beside her, Arin struggled against the same power, the pendant around her neck glowing brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have a choice,&#34; Sophia whispered. &#34;But stay close to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stepped through the doorway together, followed by the puppet-like forms of Tharros and Kael. As soon as they crossed the threshold, the doors slammed shut behind them, plunging them into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, one by one, crystals embedded in the walls began to glow, illuminating a vast circular chamber. The floor was covered in intricate mosaic patterns depicting scenes from an ancient history-the founding of Lumaria, the first corruption, the Division.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of the room stood a pedestal holding a glowing orb similar to the one Tharros had described from the memory vault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Keeper did not follow them inside. Instead, its voice continued to echo around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The truth of your bloodlines must be revealed before the keystones can be united. Begin in the library of ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A section of the wall slid open, revealing a corridor lined with crystal shelves holding thousands of memory spheres, scrolls, and tablets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they entered this new chamber, something strange happened. Kael gasped, his eyes clearing as the vacant expression vanished. He stumbled, catching himself against a shelf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael!&#34; Sophia rushed to his side. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked rapidly, looking around in confusion. &#34;I... yes. The Keeper&#39;s hold is gone.&#34; He glanced at Tharros, who remained frozen, his eyes still vacant. &#34;But why only me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin studied the room carefully. &#34;This place is responding to you specifically.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if to confirm her words, the crystal shelves began to glow wherever Kael moved near them. Symbols along the walls pulsed with blue light, following his movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this place?&#34; he wondered, touching one of the glowing shelves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his touch, a hidden panel in the floor slid open, revealing a staircase spiraling downward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re meant to go down there,&#34; Sophia said. &#34;Alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear flashed across Kael&#39;s face, quickly replaced by determination. &#34;Stay with Tharros. Try to break whatever hold the Keeper has on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before descending, he gripped Sophia&#39;s hand tightly. &#34;If I don&#39;t return in ten minutes, leave without me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not happening,&#34; she said firmly. &#34;We&#39;re all getting out of here together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded, then disappeared down the stairs. The panel closed behind him, sealing him away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned her attention to Tharros, placing her hands on either side of his face. &#34;Tharros, can you hear me? You need to fight this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, nothing happened. Then his eyes flickered, a hint of recognition breaking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The connection,&#34; Arin said. &#34;Use your bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes, focusing on the thread that connected her to Tharros-the one that had gone silent during his capture. She imagined it as a golden cord stretching between them, and poured all her energy into strengthening it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back to me,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep beneath the library, Kael found himself in a small chamber unlike anything he had ever seen in Aquaria. The walls were lined with portraits-faces that seemed strangely familiar though he had never seen them before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center stood a basin filled with silver liquid that glowed with inner light. As he approached, the liquid began to stir, forming shapes and patterns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words appeared on the surface of the liquid: PLACE YOUR HAND WITHIN TO KNOW YOUR TRUTH.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael hesitated, then slowly lowered his hand into the basin. The liquid felt warm, embracing his skin without wetting it. Immediately, images exploded in his mind-memories that weren&#39;t his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw a woman with his silver eyes standing beside six other leaders, each holding a keystone. He saw battles against the first corruption, cities falling to darkness. He saw the ritual that created the Division, splitting the world into separate realms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he saw his own bloodline, passed down through generations, always in hiding, always protected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the visions ended, Kael jerked his hand away, gasping. The truth hit him like a physical blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m descended from the royal family of Lumaria,&#34; he whispered. &#34;One of the seven who created the Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wall before him shifted, revealing an alcove containing a single crystal tablet. As he lifted it, words etched themselves across its surface:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>THE SECOND KEYSTONE LIES BENEATH THE CORAL THRONE, GUARDED BY TRIALS OF ROYAL WORTH. ONLY BLOOD OF THE SEVEN MAY PASS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chamber began to shake, dust falling from the ceiling. Kael tucked the tablet into his belt and raced back up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was still trying to reach Tharros when the floor beneath them trembled violently. Cracks appeared in the crystal walls, and several memory spheres crashed to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The panel slid open, and Kael emerged, his face pale but his eyes burning with new purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to leave,&#34; he said urgently. &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tharros is still-&#34; Sophia began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know how to free him,&#34; Kael interrupted. He pulled the crystal tablet from his belt and pressed it against Tharros&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reaction was immediate. Tharros gasped, his eyes clearing as he collapsed forward into Sophia&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Tharros demanded, looking around wildly. &#34;The Keeper-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No time,&#34; Kael said, pointing to the widening cracks in the walls. &#34;This place is coming apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ran for the main chamber, but found the tower doors still sealed. Arin&#39;s pendant glowed brighter as she approached them, and she pressed it against the center of the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand back,&#34; she warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Green light surged from the pendant, spreading across the doors in spiraling patterns. With a groan, they began to open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, chaos awaited them. The exposed seabed was now covered in water that rose by the second-the ocean returning with terrifying speed. The guardians had vanished, but the Keeper remained, watching them with its shifting form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;THE TRUTH IS REVEALED,&#34; it boomed. &#34;THE ROYAL BLOOD AWAKENS. SEEK THE KEYSTONES BEFORE THE WATERS RISE FULLY. THE CHOICE APPROACHES.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, it dissolved into the churning waters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you discover down there?&#34; Sophia asked Kael as they scrambled toward higher ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know who I am,&#34; he said, his voice tight. &#34;And I know where to find the second keystone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stopped, staring at Kael with a mixture of shock and resignation. &#34;You know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You suspected, didn&#39;t you?&#34; Kael demanded. &#34;How long have you known?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had suspicions since we first met,&#34; Tharros admitted. &#34;The silver eyes. The affinity for ancient magic. But I kept it secret to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Protect me from what?&#34; Kael&#39;s voice rose with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From those who would use you,&#34; Tharros said. &#34;The royal bloodlines were hunted after the Division. Some believed they should never return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive wave crashed against the cliffs behind them, spraying them with cold seawater. The ocean was reclaiming the land with unnatural speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get to higher ground,&#34; Arin urged, pointing to the path they had descended earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they climbed, Kael&#39;s mind raced with the implications of what he had learned. Not just a warrior, but royalty from an ancient kingdom that predated Aquaria itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway up the cliff, Sophia paused, pointing out to sea. &#34;Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where the tower had stood, a whirlpool had formed-not purple like before, but blue and gold, spinning with such force that it seemed to bend the very air around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The convergence has begun,&#34; Tharros said grimly. &#34;The Division is weakening faster than we feared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does this mean for us?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means,&#34; Kael said, looking down at the crystal tablet in his hands, &#34;that we need to get to the coral throne immediately. The second keystone is hidden beneath it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the trials?&#34; Arin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;They&#39;re designed to test royal worthiness. Only my blood can unlock them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the top of the cliff, the ground shook again. A crack opened in the earth, stretching inland as far as they could see-a physical manifestation of the mystic boundary breaking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The world is tearing itself apart,&#34; Sophia whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not tearing apart,&#34; Tharros corrected, his eyes fixed on the horizon where strange lights now danced in the darkening sky. &#34;Becoming whole again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ocean continued to rise, faster than any natural tide. Whatever time they had left was running out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sacred Tides</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The coral throne,&#34; Sophia repeated, trying to make sense of everything. &#34;Where exactly is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael clutched the crystal tablet tightly. &#34;It&#39;s in the Temple of Tides, built into the northern cliffs. The entrance only appears during the lowest tide of the year.&#34; His silver eyes widened. &#34;Which happens to be tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros, still shaky from being freed from the Keeper&#39;s control, looked at the darkening sky. &#34;That gives us less than three hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another tremor shook the ground beneath them. The crack in the earth widened, glowing with blue energy that pulsed like a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to hurry,&#34; Arin said, her pendant still glowing faintly. &#34;The Division is weakening faster than expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They rushed to Tharros&#39;s vehicle, a sleek underwater craft that had been modified for surface travel. As they sped along the coastline, Sophia stared at Kael with new eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Royal blood,&#34; she murmured. &#34;That explains so much about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;I never knew. My parents never told me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were protecting you,&#34; Tharros said, his hands gripping the controls. &#34;The royal families were hunted after the Division. Most were killed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because they had the power to undo what they had done,&#34; Arin explained. &#34;To reverse the Division if they chose to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky darkened further as they followed the coastline north. Strange lights danced across the horizon, shimmering like the northern lights but in shades of blue and gold that seemed wrong somehow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros pointed ahead to where the shoreline curved around a massive cliff face. &#34;There. That&#39;s where the temple should be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They abandoned the vehicle on a narrow strip of beach. The tide was already pulling back, revealing wet sand dotted with tide pools that glowed with unnatural light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can feel it,&#34; Arin whispered, her hand on her pendant. &#34;Ancient magic, waiting to be awakened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They followed Kael along the base of the cliffs, the receding water exposing rock formations that had been underwater for centuries. Strange symbols were carved into the stone, growing more frequent as they continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; Kael said suddenly, stopping before what appeared to be a solid wall of rock. &#34;It should be right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia placed her hand on the cold stone. &#34;Are you sure? I don&#39;t see any entrance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tablet said it would only reveal itself during the lowest tide,&#34; Kael reminded her. &#34;We might need to wait a bit longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water continued to pull back, faster than any natural tide. As it receded, the cliff face began to change. What had seemed like natural cracks in the rock slowly formed a pattern-the outline of a massive doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s working,&#34; Arin breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last of the water pulled away, and the outline of the door glowed blue. Kael stepped forward, pressing his palm against the center of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blood of the seven,&#34; he said, his voice steady despite the fear in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his touch, the stone door began to sink into the ground, revealing a dark passage that sloped downward. Cool air rushed out, carrying the scent of salt and something older, like ancient books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if it closes behind us?&#34; Sophia asked, eyeing the doorway nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we find another way out,&#34; Tharros said grimly. &#34;We don&#39;t have a choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They entered single file, Arin creating a small ball of green light to guide their way. The passage was narrow at first, then widened into a vast chamber that took their breath away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceiling soared high above them, covered in glittering crystals that reflected Arin&#39;s light in dazzling patterns. The walls were carved with scenes depicting humans and mer people working side by side, building cities both above and below the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is from before the Division,&#34; Tharros said in awe. &#34;When all peoples lived together in harmony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of the chamber stood a massive statue-a human and a mer warrior standing back to back, their hands raised together holding a sphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The coral throne,&#34; Kael whispered, approaching the statue. &#34;It&#39;s not actually a throne. It&#39;s this statue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sphere in the statue&#39;s hands glowed with inner light, pulsing in time with the strange lights they had seen in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That must be the keystone,&#34; Sophia said, moving closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she approached, the scales along her neck began to tingle and shift. The dormant magic within her stirred, responding to the keystone&#39;s power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful,&#34; Tharros warned. &#34;The trials-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, the ground shook violently. Water began to seep into the chamber from unseen cracks in the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The tide is turning!&#34; Arin shouted. &#34;We&#39;re running out of time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael moved toward the statue, but an invisible barrier stopped him. &#34;I can&#39;t reach it,&#34; he said, pushing against nothing. &#34;Something&#39;s blocking me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia tried next, but encountered the same barrier. &#34;I thought your royal blood was supposed to grant access.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It should,&#34; Kael said, frustration evident in his voice. He pressed the crystal tablet against the barrier, but nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin studied the statue more carefully. &#34;Look at the carvings at the base. They tell a story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They gathered around, watching as the carvings began to glow and shift, showing scenes of cooperation between surface dwellers and underwater peoples-building together, celebrating together, defending each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not just about royal blood,&#34; Arin realized. &#34;It&#39;s about unity. The human and mer working together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros looked at Sophia, understanding dawning in his eyes. &#34;You and Kael. You must approach it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water was now ankle-deep and rising quickly. Outside, they could hear the crashing of waves as the ocean reclaimed the shore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia reached for Kael&#39;s hand. &#34;Ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, and together they stepped toward the statue. This time, the barrier let them pass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what?&#34; Sophia asked as they stood before the statue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take the keystone,&#34; Kael said. &#34;I think... I think it&#39;s meant for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia reached up, her fingers brushing the glowing sphere between the statue&#39;s upraised hands. The moment she touched it, energy surged through her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped as the scales beneath her skin fully emerged, spreading across her neck and cheeks in beautiful iridescent patterns. Her eyes shifted, her vision suddenly sharper, clearer. The water rising around her ankles no longer felt cold, but welcoming, an extension of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle tug, the keystone came free. The moment it did, the statue began to sink into the floor, revealing a hidden passage behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quickly!&#34; Tharros shouted as water poured in faster now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They splashed through the rising water toward the new passage. As they entered, Sophia felt a strange pull from the keystone. It wanted to go deeper, to show them something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; she said, stopping. &#34;I think we need to go this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held the keystone out, and it glowed brighter, illuminating a narrow side passage they hadn&#39;t noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Arin asked, eyeing the rapidly rising water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me,&#34; Sophia said with a confidence she didn&#39;t entirely feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They followed the new passage, climbing upward as the water chased at their heels. The tunnel twisted and turned, sometimes so narrow they had to squeeze through sideways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, they emerged into another chamber, smaller than the first but no less impressive. At its center stood a pool of silver liquid, similar to what Kael had described from his vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The keystone in Sophia&#39;s hand pulled toward the pool, growing warmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now?&#34; Tharros asked, looking back at the passage where water continued to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped toward the pool, the keystone guiding her movements. &#34;I think I&#39;m supposed to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the chamber shook violently. Cracks appeared in the ceiling, and chunks of stone crashed into the pool, sending silver liquid splashing in all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s collapsing!&#34; Arin cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive section of the ceiling gave way, blocking the passage they had used to enter. Water sprayed through new cracks in the walls, quickly filling the chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clutched the keystone tightly, feeling its power thrumming through her veins. With her new connection to water, she could sense a way out-a passage hidden behind the pool, leading upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way!&#34; she shouted over the roar of rushing water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they moved toward the hidden passage, a dark shape materialized in the doorway-a figure wrapped in shadows, its eyes glowing with malevolent purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At last,&#34; the figure said in a voice that chilled their bones. &#34;The keystones begin to gather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped back in shock. The figure looked exactly like her, but with scales covering every inch of visible skin and eyes that held the darkness of the deepest ocean trenches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure smiled, revealing sharp teeth. &#34;I am what you will become when the Division ends. And I&#39;ve come to make sure you make the right choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chamber continued to collapse around them as they faced this new threat, the keystone burning in Sophia&#39;s hand like a star about to explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Royal Challenges</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay away from her!&#34; Tharros roared, stepping in front of Sophia as water continued to pour into the chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadowy figure that looked like Sophia laughed, the sound echoing oddly through the collapsing temple. &#34;You cannot stop what&#39;s already begun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael drew his weapon, a shimmering blade that glowed with blue light. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The same thing you seek,&#34; the shadow-Sophia said, pointing at the keystone clutched in Sophia&#39;s hand. &#34;But unlike you, I understand its true purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temple shuddered again. A massive crack split the ceiling, sending more debris crashing down between them and the figure. When the dust cleared, the shadow was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to move,&#34; Arin urged, pulling at Tharros&#39;s arm. &#34;This whole place is coming down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia still clutched the keystone, its light pulsing stronger now. &#34;This way,&#34; she said, pointing to a narrow passage revealed behind the silver pool. &#34;I can feel something calling from there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They squeezed through the opening just as another section of ceiling collapsed. The passage sloped upward, away from the rising water. After several twists and turns, they emerged into a vast cavern that took their breath away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walls glittered with embedded crystals that caught the light from the keystone, filling the space with dancing colors. At the center of the cavern stood three massive stone archways arranged in a triangle. In the middle of the triangle, a small pedestal rose from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; Sophia whispered, pointing to symbols carved into the pedestal. They matched the markings on the crystal tablet Kael carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael approached cautiously, studying the ancient writing. &#34;It says these are the Trials of Heritage. Only one with royal blood can pass through and claim what lies beyond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros frowned. &#34;More tests? We don&#39;t have time for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have a choice,&#34; Kael replied. He traced his fingers over the symbols. &#34;Three trials: strength, wisdom, and blood. If I complete them, we get the second keystone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped closer, still holding the first keystone. &#34;But we already have one. Why do we need another?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because one isn&#39;t enough,&#34; Arin said grimly. &#34;The tablet speaks of seven keystones-one for each of the royal families who created the Division. We need them all to seal the cracks between worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or to break them completely,&#34; Tharros added quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another tremor shook the cavern, smaller than before but a reminder that time was running out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to try,&#34; Kael said, determination hardening his silver eyes. He turned to his friends. &#34;Wait here. This is something I must do alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grabbed his hand. &#34;Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers squeezed hers briefly before he stepped toward the first archway. As soon as he crossed the threshold, the stone glowed bright blue, and the opening sealed behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael!&#34; Sophia cried out, rushing forward only to be stopped by Tharros.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust him,&#34; the dragon king said. &#34;This is his destiny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the first archway, Kael found himself in a circular arena. Stone statues of warriors lined the walls, each holding different weapons. At first, they seemed like ordinary decorations-until they stepped from their pedestals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s heart pounded as the statues surrounded him, their stone eyes glowing with magic. &#34;The test of strength,&#34; he muttered, raising his blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first statue lunged, swinging a massive stone sword. Kael ducked and rolled, feeling the air whoosh as the blade passed over his head. He slashed at the statue&#39;s legs, but his sword bounced off harmlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two more statues attacked from behind. Kael spun, blocking one strike but taking a painful blow to his shoulder from the other. He stumbled back, reassessing his strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t beat them with force alone,&#34; he realized. The royal blood in his veins seemed to warm at this thought, and suddenly he knew what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of fighting against the statues, he began moving with them, redirecting their momentum. As one rushed him, he sidestepped and guided its stone arm into another statue. Both cracked from the impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange energy built within him-his heritage awakening. With each movement, silver light trailed from his hands. When he next struck a statue, his blade cut through stone as if it were water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining statues attacked at once. Kael felt power surge through him, and he leapt impossibly high, spinning in midair. Silver energy exploded outward from his blade, shattering all the remaining guardians at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the dust settled, a door appeared in the far wall. Breathing hard, Kael stepped through and found himself in a library filled with ancient scrolls. The second archway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to the Test of Wisdom,&#34; a voice whispered from the shadows. A ghostly figure materialized-an old man with kind eyes but no substance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To pass, you must answer three riddles,&#34; the ghost explained. &#34;Answer correctly, and you proceed. Answer wrongly...&#34; The ghost smiled sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded, ready to face this challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First riddle: I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch will soon turn red. What am I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael thought carefully. &#34;Fire,&#34; he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ghost nodded. &#34;Second riddle: I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. What am I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was harder. Kael closed his eyes, seeking wisdom from his newly awakened royal blood. The answer came to him suddenly. &#34;A map.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correct,&#34; the ghost said, seeming pleased. &#34;Final riddle: What belongs to you, but others use it more than you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael frowned, considering various possibilities. What could others use more than its owner? The answer struck him with surprising clarity. &#34;My name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ghost clapped his transparent hands. &#34;Well done, prince of two worlds. The final test awaits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The library faded, and Kael found himself in a small, bare chamber. In the center stood a simple basin filled with clear water. Above it floated a small crystal-similar to the keystone Sophia carried, but smaller and unfinished somehow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Test of Heritage,&#34; Kael murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached the basin cautiously. Words appeared on its surface: ONLY ROYAL BLOOD CAN AWAKEN THE SLEEPING STONE.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael understood. Drawing his dagger, he made a small cut across his palm. Blood welled up, bright red against his skin. He held his hand over the basin, letting three drops fall into the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his blood touched the surface, the water turned silver. The floating crystal pulsed, growing brighter and more defined. Kael reached out, and the crystal moved into his palm as if drawn by a magnet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth spread up his arm and throughout his body. Memories not his own flashed through his mind-the founding of Lumaria, the creation of the Division, the scattering of the royal families. With each memory, more of his heritage awakened. His silver eyes glowed brighter, and markings similar to those on Tharros appeared on his skin, shimmering with inner light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wall before him dissolved, revealing a passage back to his friends. As he stepped through, Sophia gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael! Your eyes-your skin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at himself. The royal markings covered his arms now, pulsing with silver light that matched the crystal in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did it,&#34; Tharros said, impressed despite himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not just that,&#34; Kael replied, his voice stronger and more confident than before. &#34;I remembered. The Division wasn&#39;t just to separate worlds-it was to protect something. Something dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;The Leviathan. The creature of pure corruption that threatened to destroy both realms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Kael nodded. &#34;And now it&#39;s waking up again. That shadow we saw-it&#39;s not Sophia&#39;s future. It&#39;s the Leviathan taking her form, trying to manipulate us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clutched her keystone tighter. &#34;What does it want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wants us to gather the keystones,&#34; Kael explained. &#34;But not to seal the Division-to shatter it completely. It believes with the barriers down, it can consume both worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another tremor, stronger than before, shook the cavern. A crack appeared in one wall, and seawater began to seep through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to leave,&#34; Tharros urged. &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they hurried toward an exit tunnel, Sophia paused, staring at the two keystones they now possessed. &#34;Wait. If the Leviathan wants us to find the keystones, should we even be looking for them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael met her gaze, his silver eyes reflecting determination. &#34;We don&#39;t have a choice. Without all seven, we can&#39;t repair the Division either. But now we know we can&#39;t just blindly follow the path set before us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the tunnel entrance, a familiar dark shape materialized, blocking their escape. The shadow-Sophia smiled, its eyes now glowing with purple fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two down, five to go,&#34; it purred. &#34;You&#39;re doing so well. I&#39;ll be waiting for you at the Coral Throne.&#34; The figure dissolved into mist, leaving the path clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did it mean?&#34; Sophia asked, her voice trembling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael looked at the crystal in his hand, its light pulsing in sync with the keystone Sophia carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means,&#34; he said grimly, &#34;that finding the remaining keystones isn&#39;t going to be as simple as passing a few tests. The real trial is figuring out what to do with them when we have them all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cavern rumbled again, and the crack in the wall widened. This time, it wasn&#39;t just water seeping through-something large and dark moved behind the opening, something with glowing eyes and ancient hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run!&#34; Tharros shouted, as the wall began to crumble behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Scholar&#39;s Map</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run!&#34; Tharros shouted as the wall crumbled behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sprinted through the tunnel, the sound of rushing water and something large chasing them echoing off the stone walls. The two keystones pulsed brighter as they ran, lighting their way forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There!&#34; Arin pointed to a narrow crack in the wall ahead. &#34;I feel fresh air coming from there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They squeezed through just as massive claws scraped the stone behind them. Outside, they found themselves on a rocky shelf overlooking the ocean. The temple had been built into a cliff face, now partly collapsed into the sea below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clutched her keystone, breathing hard. &#34;That was too close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded, his new royal markings still glowing on his skin. &#34;We need to get somewhere safe to figure out our next move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know someone who might help,&#34; Arin said quietly. When everyone turned to her, she looked uncomfortable. &#34;An old scholar I met years ago. He studies energy patterns in the ocean-patterns like these keystones create.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros frowned. &#34;You never mentioned this before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think it mattered until now.&#34; Arin&#39;s eyes flashed. &#34;He lives in seclusion for a reason. Many have tried to use his knowledge for power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we trust him?&#34; Sophia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More than we can trust anyone else right now,&#34; Arin replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way down the cliff to where their underwater transport was hidden. As they sped through the deep currents, Sophia studied her keystone, watching how it seemed to pulse in rhythm with Kael&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re like heartbeats,&#34; she whispered. &#34;Like they&#39;re alive somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin guided them to a remote part of the ocean where massive underwater caves dotted the seafloor. One cave entrance was ringed with strange, glowing symbols that changed color as they approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He knows we&#39;re coming,&#34; Arin said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the cave opened into a vast library. Shelves carved from living coral held thousands of scrolls, tablets, and oddly shaped objects. Maps covered the walls-not ordinary maps, but swirling patterns of light that moved and shifted like the currents outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An old mer-man with a long white beard and bright, curious eyes swam out from behind a shelf. His tail was faded blue, and patches of scales were missing, showing his great age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin Blacktide,&#34; he said, his voice surprisingly strong. &#34;It&#39;s been decades. And you&#39;ve brought friends-and two keystones!&#34; His eyes widened at the sight of the glowing crystals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scholar Nereus,&#34; Arin bowed slightly. &#34;We need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nereus circled them, his eyes fixed on the keystones. When he spotted the royal markings on Kael&#39;s skin, he gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A royal descendant! I thought all the bloodlines were lost after the Division.&#34; He squinted at Kael. &#34;Which family are you from, boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Kael admitted. &#34;I only just discovered my heritage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nereus nodded thoughtfully, then turned to Sophia. &#34;And you-you&#39;re not from our world at all, are you? Yet that keystone chose you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia met his gaze steadily. &#34;I&#39;m trying to understand what that means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means the old prophecies aren&#39;t as straightforward as we thought.&#34; Nereus swam to a particular shelf and pulled down a crystal sphere. When he set it on a pedestal, it projected a map onto the cave ceiling-a map of glowing lines crisscrossing the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve spent my life tracking energy patterns,&#34; he explained. &#34;The keystones create ripples in the magic that flows through our waters. When the Division was created, those ripples were balanced perfectly. But now-&#34; he gestured at the map, where dark patches disrupted the glowing lines, &#34;-now that balance is breaking down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros growled. &#34;We know that already. What we need is to find the other keystones before the Leviathan does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nereus raised an eyebrow. &#34;The Leviathan? So it&#39;s awakened again.&#34; He sighed heavily. &#34;I feared this day would come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swam to another shelf and returned with a small, ancient tablet. &#34;Your keystones should react to this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he placed the tablet near their crystals, both keystones flashed brightly. The tablet&#39;s surface changed, revealing a map with seven points of light. Two pulsed strongly-their keystones. A third glowed steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There,&#34; Nereus pointed. &#34;The third keystone. It&#39;s hidden beneath a lighthouse on the northern shore. A lighthouse that has never failed, even in the worst storms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Everglow Lighthouse,&#34; Arin whispered. &#34;I know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia leaned forward. &#34;What about the others?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They remain hidden until you possess the one before it,&#34; Nereus explained. &#34;A safeguard, I suspect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael studied the map carefully. &#34;So we just need to collect them all and use them to reinforce the Division, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nereus frowned. &#34;It&#39;s not that simple. The keystones were created with dual purpose-they can strengthen the Division or destroy it completely. The intention of those who gather them shapes their power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia remembered the shadow-Sophia&#39;s words. &#34;And the Leviathan wants us to gather them so it can use them to break the Division.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely.&#34; Nereus touched the tablet again, and the image changed to show two worlds colliding. &#34;If all seven keystones are brought together with destruction in mind, both realms will collide. The Leviathan feeds on chaos-such a collision would give it unlimited power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we shouldn&#39;t find them at all,&#34; Tharros argued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not an option,&#34; Nereus shook his head sadly. &#34;The Division is already failing. Without the keystones, both worlds will eventually collapse anyway. Your only hope is to find them first and use them with pure intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt a chill run through her. &#34;How do we know our intentions are pure enough? The Leviathan is manipulating us already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nereus swam closer to her, his old eyes kind but serious. &#34;That&#39;s the real test, isn&#39;t it? Not finding the keystones, but knowing your own heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden tremor shook the cave, sending scrolls tumbling from shelves. Outside, the water darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s found us,&#34; Kael said, his hand going to his weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nereus quickly pressed the tablet into Sophia&#39;s hands. &#34;Take this. It will guide you to the lighthouse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with us,&#34; Sophia urged.</p>
