                <p>His mother asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not even her own name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence among the three of them again as they pondered on what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen reached out to her son, her small hands grazing the calluses on his large hand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Remy. I can&#39;t imagine what you&#39;re going through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy sighed. Oh he was going through a lot. A whole lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t even feel the mating bond. Still can&#39;t feel it now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He massaged his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;ll come back slowly. If she truly came back from the dead then I suppose it&#39;ll take some time before her body adjusts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what do you think happened to her?! And why did she run away in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy wished he knew the answers to those questions. He truly wished he could answer why his mate, the one person who was supposed to love and protect him kept running away from himwith every chance she got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He truly wished there was an answer. A right one too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. But make sure everywhere is locked and guarded tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just in case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the meantime. We will try and help her adjust. The doctor said she will regain her memory slowly in the next few weeks since there seems to be no brain damage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will all help her remember. Show her all her favorite things and teach her everything all over again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. We have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I believe she&#39;s still a bit sensitive and weary around us so let&#39;s be careful with how we speak and handle her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Kale... tell everyone not to address her as Luna for the time being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think? You think she doesn&#39;t know?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That she&#39;s a werewolf? I&#39;m almost positive she doesn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy mentioned as he sighed once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-b-but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy raised his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only for a short time. I&#39;ll break the news to her so you don&#39;t have to worry about that. Just keep everyone who isn&#39;t you or my mother away from her for the time being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They talked about mundane things that happened when he left and his mother and his Beta left the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally left Remy buried his hands in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The goddess had dealt him a cruel hand it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been elated, ecstatic even at the fact that he had a mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he found her he felt whole, whole and more complete than he had ever felt. His pack had called his reign special. He was giving them their first Luna in almost a century.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh he got a Luna alright. Just not what he was expecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a bath, the bathroom was splendid and the water was deliciously warm. After spending uncomfortable days in the hospital she felt strangely relieved to be somewhere else. Even though it was unfamiliar. She picked up a dress from the closet and a cardigan and she tried the door to exit the room and noticed that it was locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locked?! Why? Was she a prisoner here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked herself as she knocked the door urgently, no one came to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated and mildly annoyed she went back to the bed and laid back in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was locked in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he do that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t she his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or did he intend to keep her in the room forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes and shortly after she fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy walked in to find Valentina sleeping. Her hands folded and her breathing normal. She had changed into a dress. A light pink shirt dress that she very rarely wore. It was her least favorite dress. He wondered if she remembered that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the room, he shuffled around and put some things back in their place. The whole pack house was in a flurry of activities following her arrival. The chef was preparing a feast and his mother was supervising. Unfortunately they wouldn&#39;t be able to have a big dinner as they had planned since Remy didn&#39;t want to freak her out. His mother was disappointed but she understood the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only he and her would have dinner together that night. Everyone else would be away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted and suddenly her eyes opened and settled on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said and she sat upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You locked me in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded more of an accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want anyone to disturb you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He explained but she didn&#39;t look convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said we were married. What kind of relationship did we have for me to take off my ring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy opened his mouth but words failed to come out. To be honest, he had no idea. Their relationship was strained at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I- I can&#39;t explain it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were boring into his at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will have to. Because I don&#39;t trust you. And everything you have been doing, up until this moment is making me uncomfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I? I make you uncomfortable?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. You only tell me of our time when we were married. Nothing more. Don&#39;t I have any family? Can&#39;t I see them, instead of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shook his head. He put his hands on his hips as he glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no family! That&#39;s all I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer stunned her. She blinked once, twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t. No family. No friends. Nobody but me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she somehow felt that he was probably telling the truth, she couldn&#39;t believe that. He could be lying. He could be very good at lying. There was no way she had no family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible for one not to have no family or friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just lying to keep her in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a liar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would plot her escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought as she walked away from him and into the bathroom without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She locked the door behind her, panting slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked up to the mirror and looked at her face again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh she wished she would just remember something. Something... anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would really help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opted to have dinner alone in her bedroom, despite the silent protests of  her supposed husband, he had left her alone and sheate the meal alone in the room. The chef had apparently cooked her favorite meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A baked rigatoni pasta with beef and tomato cream. She liked the meal, it was good, but she didn&#39;t think it was good enough to be her favorite meal. She wondered if there was a meal she would like and her mind wandered towards Chinese food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly craved a warm hearty bowl of chicken noodle soup with a side of  soup dumplings. She didn&#39;t know where the craving came from but she suspected that it was her favorite food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could almost taste it in her mouth, like a memory, hard to grasp, but she could feel the taste on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner she took her plates down the grand stairs herself and navigated the large mansion just to find her the kitchen. Unlike before, nobody obstructed her path, and she met no one on the way till she finally found the kitchen by scent alone. The fragrant meal and the smell of pasta still smelled faintly in the hallways and it was what led her to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, there was her supposed husband&#39;s mother in the kitchen. She was bent over the sink, washing her hands. She turned when she saw her and beamed. Drying her hands quickly and rushing to get the tray from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help you with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman said and Valentina murmured a thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you like the meal?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina nodddd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was really good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least it was filling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman stared for a while before nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. It&#39;s your favorite meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said and Valentina nodded again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that she could remember anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remington and his mother sort of looked alike. The eye color was the same and he seemed to have inherited a few of his soft features from his mother. She was a small woman, with wrinkles around her eyes and dark brown hair spotted with grey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked about her late fifties or early sixties. And there was something warm about her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I didn&#39;t make it. Chef Murray did. He makes all our food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around. There was no sign of anybody. No chef, no nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman noticed her glancing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most of the staff stay in the annex.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She explained and Valentina nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly had a brilliant idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it possible for you to give me a tour? Maybe it might help me remember...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and the woman looked excited to, relieved even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held Valentina&#39;s hand and dragged her out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Of course yes.&#34;</p>
