                <p>I held him tightly in my arms and I stroked him, feeling his milk-like skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was my child and Isaac&#39;s, he had my blood and Isaac&#39;s blood in him, and just from his eyes, I could already feel the extraordinary future he would have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my head, then placed the child in swaddling clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the months I had been in contact with the wizard, I had asked him to help me prophesy a few times about my health. Now that the baby was born, maybe I could ask him to help prophesy again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it, I took out a clear crystal ball from a nearby cabinet, which was given to me by the wizard at the White Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Luna Claudia, aren&#39;t you also a powerful witch, why do you want another wizard to prophesy?&amp;quot; The doctor seemed to have some concern, but I smiled and shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That wizard possesses a magical witchcraft ability, his prophecies are very accurate, and they are also very fast, and he is even able to prophesy to many people in a row. I suspect that he should have a very powerful bloodline, just like mine.&amp;quot; After saying that, I used my hand to start stroking the crystal ball. The spell ran through my mind and after just a second had passed, I saw the crystal ball emit a faint glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, did you contact me for something?&amp;quot; Along with the familiar voice, I saw the wizard in the robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never told me his name, and although I felt something strange, I did not make an inquiry, which might have his personal reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My child has been born, I would like to ask you to perform another prophecy, money is not a problem.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Your child has been born?&amp;quot; I heard some unusual trembling in his voice at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, can I ask for your help?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sincerely pleaded with him, but what I didn&#39;t expect was that the crystal ball suddenly emitted a bright gray light at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This gray glow almost made me unable to open my eyes for a short period of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What&#39;s going on?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the glow diminished, the next moment I saw that there was a person in robes who had appeared in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, your child has finally been born, do you know how long I have waited for this day!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his voice, I suddenly felt the ground tremble, and the next moment, a huge palm made of white bones actually emerged from the ground!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What&#39;s going on? What the hell do you want?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never seen such a witchcraft before at all, and I only had time to quickly use the Wood Witchcraft - Giant Wood Barrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when the wall made of trees just appeared, it was quickly torn apart by the white bone palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a powerful force!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face became grave, I knew that this wizard was not joking with me, he wanted to do something!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put all of my mind&#39;s abilities to work at this time, and just as the palm was about to come to my side, a dazzling green light coalesced in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wooden Witchcraft - Elf&#39;s Tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next moment a tree emitting light appeared in the air out of nowhere in front of the huge palm made of white bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of a collision rang in my ears, and I was relieved to see that the witchcraft I had used had blocked the white bones&#39; attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could make my next move, some black tentacles suddenly emerged from inside my shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is this thing!&amp;quot; The child in my arms was snatched away in the next second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, let go of my child!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed in terror, but the tentacles were so fast that they took my child almost in an instant, and then I saw the tentacles carrying my child to the wizard&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I was going to take you away together, but I didn&#39;t expect you to become this strong in your witchcraft ability, even if I use dark witchcraft, there is no way to defeat your.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dark witchcraft?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a lightning bolt flash inside my head, and I remembered at this time the evil wizard that Miranda was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are the wizard who wants to destroy the coven!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in disbelief, perhaps I should have realized it earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be able to use powerful prophecy witchcraft that quickly and continuously was not something an ordinary wizard could do, it was the effect of dark witchcraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, are you just now realizing this? When I gave you the crystal ball from the very beginning, I had already arranged the witchcraft of teleportation inside the crystal ball and I have hidden it. I can teleport to your side at any time and kidnap you or your child.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of this he laughed, his laugh was hoarse like a glass that was rubbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, although today did not kidnap you, but get your child is enough, and finally telling you one more thing, the pack I was in is Blood Moon Pack, when in the White Pack, to kidnap you is also my plan!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that I saw a gray light appeared in front of me, and the next moment his body completely disappeared in this space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, my child!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried with all my might to stop it, but it was to no avail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at this moment and saw that the servants and the doctor had already fallen to the ground from the horror of this witchcraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They did not play any role in the face of the powerful wizard who was using black witchcraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My child, my newly born child ......&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood helplessly on the ground, it was in the next moment I heard Nicole&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, you do not have to worry. Now that your child has been born, you can transform into a wolf, and with the use of witchcraft together with me and you, you are stronger than at any previous moment, and we have the ability to save your child and help Isaac defeat Blood Moon Pack!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Nicole&#39;s reassurance, determination appeared in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I was stronger than ever before, and even if he was a powerful wizard using black witchcraft, I was able to defeat him with my werewolf and witch powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I was no weaker than Isaac, and the road ahead was at my feet, and I would use my current power to destroy Blood Moon Pack, the evil wolf pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, the incantation ran through my mind, and the next moment my body had disappeared into the room, while I saw it. One of the giant wolf, over twenty feet in size and made of wood, was standing beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the more advanced wood sorcery that I had learned - the giant wolf of the forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack, wait, I will make you understand that the true power of witchcraft is not something that can be defeated by your kind of evil means.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used the teleportation array and the heart link between the mate to transport me to Isaac&#39;s side. That wizard placed my child in the center of the spell formation at the moment, which gave me a strong sense of unease, and the blood moon pack&#39;s alpha used my child as a threat to get Isaac to give up his resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instantly transformed into a wolf and saved Isaac from under the Alpha of the blood moon pack. The magic array suddenly emitted a light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, my power!&amp;quot; The light had an adverse effect on blood moon pack&#39;s Alpha, and he screamed and shouted with a distorted face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and I exchanged glances with each other, then I took control of blood moon pack&#39;s Alpha&#39;s limbs with witchcraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Jim, help!&amp;quot; the unmovable blood moon pack&#39;s Alpha pleaded for help towards the wizard, but the wizard didn&#39;t pay attention to him, and Isaac directly bit his neck off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Today you will all become the feed of the spell formation! Today I can finally destroy the entire coven!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the giant forest wolf rush into the spell formation to bring out my children, but the giant forest wolf was instantly turned into ashes because of the spell formation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t bother, you can&#39;t take him away unless he can walk out by himself, haha&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his words, Isaac and I both frowned at how a newborn baby could possibly walk. At this point I felt great despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I felt a wave of energy and Miranda arrived with the great witches of the coven. Miranda stared into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We will use all our witch power to control the spell formation and Jim, you use the mind link and then control your child, after using the forest giant wolf to cover your wolf, you can enter the spell formation and bring him out safely.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the tacit cooperation of all of us, Jim was controlled limbs, and the spell formation emitted a burst of white light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Quick, Claudia!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instantly unleashed my witchcraft and made the giant forest wolf cover the outside of my wolf form and rushed into the spell formation, at the same time, I saw Isaac rushing towards the controlled Jim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering the magic formation, the intense burning sensation made me feel painful, I quickly picked up my child, and a second before the giant forest wolf turned into ashes, I quickly used water witchcraft to wrap me and my child, and then managed to save my child before my witch power ran out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, it&#39;s all over!&amp;quot; Isaac clung to me and the child with the smell of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, it&#39;s over...&amp;quot; I looked at the clear sky, and the child in my arms, and let out a long breath.</p>
