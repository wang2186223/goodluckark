                <p>&amp;quot;Grandfather?&amp;quot; He smiled as soon as I said those words. What the hell is he doing here? The elders shouldn&#39;t be here. Did something happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Finally your awake. We have a lot of things to talk about but for the time being you should rest.&amp;quot; I just nodded my head still confused about everything that is happening right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father took a step back and my mother stood beside her while Sarah was still holding my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;When did you get back here? How come I don&#39;t remember?&amp;quot; She giggled at my words then rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I came back months ago silly. You even welcomed me that time.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t say anything and just stared at her. Something feels like I was missing something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What happened? Why am I here?&amp;quot; I glance at the white room filled with machines that I just saw for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Son, we were betrayed by the Royalties and we were attacked by the Rogues which lead you into this state. But what is important right now is you are awake.&amp;quot; My mother mumbled, Royalties? I felt a slight headache upon remembering their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How did that happened?&amp;quot; They both look at each other. Again that same look again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Remember we were supposed to continue the treaty agreement but during the time of your succession we were attacked by Rogues.&amp;quot; Glimpse of the succession came flooding in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was waiting for their arrival to begin the succession. Sarah was beside me that time. Then they finally arrived, I remember the faces of four people but one of them is blurry, she was wearing a long white lace gown. She was glowing but only her face is what I cannot recognize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember that she was the one who leas the succession rights, I swear I can still feel the sensation when she touch my forehead which is weird. Then after that a loud explosion happened followed by the rogues. The next thing that happened was blank. All I can remember was there is a man with red eyes. Rubies like eyes that feels cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my head feeling a slight pain, Sarah held me in her arms and started whispering something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t try to remember, everything is okay now.&amp;quot; She mumbled then I suddenly feel my headache vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I need to know the details.&amp;quot; I mumbled staring directly to my father who nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We will talk this later, now get dress so you could return to your room.&amp;quot; Now that he mentioned it, I was wearing nothing but a hospital gown.  He then turn to Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sarah, would you please help Dwayne for a while. We will just talk to the Elders about him waking up.&amp;quot; Sarah smiled and nodded her head. She pulled something in the corner, it was a pair of clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wear this, I took it from your room.&amp;quot; She mumbled, then I slip into it. I don&#39;t know why but I suddenly feel weird around Sarah. It was really uncomfortable looking at her right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe because I couldn&#39;t remember anything that happened? Just glimpse of memories resurface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How long was I asleep?&amp;quot; She stop for a while then turn around to face me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;About a month? We were really worried after you encountered the Royalties. You almost died in their hands.&amp;quot; She started tearing up, I pulled her into a hug trying to comfort her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Shh... I&#39;m awake now. Nothing bad happened to me.&amp;quot; I mumbled, she stop crying after a few minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I was just happy that you are back. My Dwayne is back!&amp;quot; She mumbled, I don&#39;t know why I found her words weird or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Hunter was right, I just need to rest for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reach the packhouse everyone was giving me a weird look. Okay what is happening? They all received a glare at Sarah which they all took in and snap their eyes away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I open the door, my room still looks the same as before. Nothing much change except for some new furniture or should I say all my furniture are new. What happened here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh, your room furniture was change because you said so. Before you fell unconscious you demanded to change them.&amp;quot; She mumbled, I didn&#39;t say anything and went to my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m okay now Sarah, you can leave. I know you have other things to do especially after you became an omega.&amp;quot; I uttered. &amp;quot;Wait did you succeed that title?&amp;quot; She shakes her and stared at me with the same sad look in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Before the attack, you ask me to be your Luna and right before the marking that happened. I really thought I will lose you forever. I couldn&#39;t even do something. I was really pathetic.&amp;quot; She started sobbing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask her to be my Luna? I don&#39;t understand why but I felt like inside me there was something else behind the Luna title. Or I&#39;m still in shock after all the time I was asleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told her to come close to me and held her hand. I was aware about her being my Luna, because that was all my plan after everything I took from her. How can I forget most of my memories this past few months yet still remember wide and clear about that time where I took so much from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stroke her hair, and she just stared at me in the eyes. Then suddenly I saw a pair of gray-blue eyes staring at me. I blink away. Feeling a bit confused. What was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What&#39;s wrong?&amp;quot; I pulled my hand away from her and stared ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nothing, I think I was seeing thing.&amp;quot; I uttered, she look uncomfortable with my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Maybe because your body is still recovering.&amp;quot; She mumbled, her heart is pounding. I can hear it loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you okay? Your heart beats is faster than before.&amp;quot; She look away and played with her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I was just surprised that you pulled away. I thought that you will going to kiss me.&amp;quot; I can&#39;t say anything after her words. And just held her cheek up then do the only right thing I know. I kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips feels unfamiliar, I close my eyes trying to ignore my thoughts. Something is missing, then some vanilla scent caught my nostrils that made me pull away. She stared at me with a questionable look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry, I thought someone is here.&amp;quot; I mumbled, I can&#39;t even dare to look at her. I know she was hurt with my sudden reaction. Especially if after what she was saying is true then we are bond to be mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mates... Why does that feels so familiar in my mouth yet still so out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I understand, maybe you just need to get some sleep?&amp;quot; She suggested and I nodded my head. But before she left I gave her a peck on the lips. Just to at least try to ease the tension building up between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ll see you later. I love you.&amp;quot; I wanted to say those words back but it was like there is a huge lump in my throat. When she notice that I didn&#39;t response she just smile and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel my guilt. Sarah doesn&#39;t deserve that kind of reaction from me. After she waited and stayed by my side the whole time I was unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I close my eyes again a pair of gray-blue eyes stared at me. I open my eyes in a hurry. Why am I seeing that? I massage my temples because my head was hurting again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What is wrong with you Dwayne?&amp;quot; I let out a deep sigh before deciding that I should go and talk to my father and figure out what happened before I fell unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I step inside the office my father was busy with some documents. If what I remember was right I was already the Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dad, I should be the one doing that.&amp;quot; He stops and glance at my direction. He looks hesitant but then decided to gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne you were strip off the title because of the things happened before you fell unconscious.&amp;quot; I stared at him with disbelief. Why would I be strip off my title?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You must be joking? What did I do?&amp;quot; I can sense the horror in my voice. Do I really want to know what did I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Son, I know it was hard to take in but before you are manipulated by the Royalties which resulted for you to betray the pack.&amp;quot; Now he was babbling nonsense. Why would I betray my own pack but the look he had was telling me he was telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is that the reason why everyone was staring at me earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But that was in the past now my Son, after you woke up from their manipulation things will get better. But that doesn&#39;t mean I could just give you back the Alpha Title.&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t say anything, I can&#39;t still believe what I&#39;m hearing from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just who are these royalties? How can they just manipulate me like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He close the document he was checking and motion me to take a seat. I complied quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Son, after the succession you were taken with them. We found you in an Island past the forbidden area. Sarah almost lost her life because of that human girl who manipulated you.&amp;quot; Human girl? Then I the image of the female one who was with the Royalties flash in my mind. I still cannot see her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then flashes of the memories in the Island, all I can see is red, dead bodice scattered around. And then Sarah, she was almost lifeless when we reach the place. Then I saw her, she was looking down at us and she wasn&#39;t alone. I can&#39;t picture her face but what I remember is that she had a pair of red eyes. The same eyes that I saw during the succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you remember now? When you returned from the Island, you were told to retrieve the people who betrayed us but instead you help then escape and attack you own Elder. You were strip off your title after that. And we have to do something to get you out of their grip. We did everything we could but it was all useless until the Elder decided to put you to sleep. And it help and what is important is now you are back.&amp;quot; He clench my hand and I just remain silent. I couldn&#39;t believe what I just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You might not be able to remember everything but at least you are back to your old self Dwayne. That is what matters.&amp;quot; Is that the reason why I couldn&#39;t remember the details of what he was saying. Only some fraction of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why but I suddenly felt angry. Just who are those Royalties to put me into this situation. I clench my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That is what I wanted you to feel.&amp;quot; A man with a cloak entered, he was wearing a cloak that is why I can&#39;t see his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My King, I thought you wouldn&#39;t arrive until the next day. &amp;quot; My King? Who is this? He pulled his cloak out showing a pair of red eyes and a flocks of silver-white hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I couldn&#39;t stop myself for being curious with my new creation.&amp;quot; He mumbled directing his words to me. New creation? What on earth was he saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne please give some respect.&amp;quot; I don&#39;t know why but my body move on its own and bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh right, you lost some of your memories. But don&#39;t worry they will return little by little. I hope to watch your full potential grow.&amp;quot; And with that he vanish through thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to my father and told me about the Legend, and he said he was the person who started the Faction. He told me about the reason why he was called the King because he was the one who stablish the four territories which are the Faction. And he went missing for a while but then decided to return after hearing about the Royalties and the Rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is really a lot of things that I missed out. I don&#39;t know why but seeing him made me feel uncomfortable. It was like my body was telling me that he was a bad news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne! Can you hear me?&amp;quot; I glance to Sarah who is busy eating ice cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask her out after feeling guilty about how I reacted towards her. And I want to look around the pack. Because it felt like ages since I walk around here. I still felt the gazes of our pack members but I just ignored them and Sarah was there to glare back at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was just recalling my talk with my father earlier.&amp;quot; She pouted but then smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As I was saying, the other pack are here. But I heard that they will return to their own territories by Saturday.&amp;quot; She mumbled, I haven&#39;t even encountered them after I woke up. Especially Zion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Have you seen Zion?&amp;quot; She froze at my words then look down in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;He went missing after your retrieval to the traitors in the South. No one heard anything after that, what we know is he was one of people who help the Rogues during that time.&amp;quot; I cannot believe what her words was saying. Zion? Help the Rogues?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That&#39;s impossible.&amp;quot; That&#39;s it! I refuse to believe her words. Zion would never betrayed his pack especially with Rogues. He hated them so much. After his brothers death he promise to kill every rogues he encountered. But now she was telling me he choose their side? That was unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m telling the truth! Zion was the mate of one of those traitors! Maybe that is the reason why he was pulled into their side.&amp;quot; Mate? How could that be? He only had eyes on Sarah. But what she was saying made sense. Because Zion won&#39;t do something unreasonable without a reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How could I let my Beta do that?&amp;quot; I don&#39;t know why but as I discover what I did this past few months it made me realize that I was a worst Alpha. Maybe my Father was right to take the title away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are under that witch control! You wouldn&#39;t do that if it wasn&#39;t because of her.&amp;quot; I clench my fist, but Sarah hold my hand and I released them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I would never forgive that woman.&amp;quot; I mumbled through gritted teeth. Just who is that woman to play me like this. It cause me so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We will get her soon Dwayne. And you will be the one who will take her back here.&amp;quot; She mumbled, I just nodded my head at her. I will get her back here and make sure she will pay for what she have done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s been a while Dwayne.&amp;quot; I glance up and see Cameron, I can&#39;t remember much about him but his face and name was familiar enough for me to recognize him. He took the seat in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; I answered, he just ignored my reply. Showing how much I don&#39;t like him around me. I don&#39;t know why but I can&#39;t ignore the fact that I feel so hostile around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Seems like you finally return from your lovesick incident.&amp;quot; Sarah was looking uncomfortable right now. Love sick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop!&amp;quot; Sarah mumbled but he ignored it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Oh looks like you don&#39;t remember, you are just so lovesick with that human which made you really crazy over her. I can even remember how much you hated us for just talking to her that time. It just suck that you ended up being manipulated by her.&amp;quot; Sarah just watch me clench my fist, she tried to calm me down but I can feel my anger growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That&#39;s enough Cameron! Dwayne don&#39;t listen to him. You just don&#39;t know what she did to you and it was all her fault.&amp;quot; She mumbled, but I ignored her. All I can think of is how to wipe that smirk on his face. Just hearing him talk about her that way made me furious. Wait! What did I just say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head and grab Sarah&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s go Sarah.&amp;quot; Sarah didn&#39;t say anything and followed me. We left him with a smirk on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just why am I so mad about him? Dwayne! It was all because he was spatting some nonsense. Don&#39;t let it get to you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Dwayne where are we going?&amp;quot; I totally forgot about Sarap. I stop and found ourselves walking towards the East, where the East Mansion is located.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sorry, I just want to get some fresh air.&amp;quot; I mumbled, scratching the back of my head. I never been here before, I&#39;m sure that the last time I went towards this area was when I was still a child. But why does it felt so familiar. That I could go hear with my eyes close and still find the way towards this area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Let&#39;s just go back and ignore what Cameron said.&amp;quot; I glance once more to the way towards the East Mansion before following Sarah.</p>
