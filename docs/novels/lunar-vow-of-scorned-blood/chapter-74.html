                <p>Clint came to my room but didn&#39;t say anything and decided to walk away. What was just that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like someone&#39;s brother misses his little sister.&#34; I turn around to find the only person who could talk to me casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz was on my bed, leaning on his shoulders while narrowing his eyebrows. I rolled my eyes at him. Our relationship became more closer as times goes by. He always says that I was just like his little sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why am I always surrounded with people who have sibling issues? It&#39;s been a while since the others arrived here. Kariz ordered us to stay quiet for a while. Because the Faction is hunting us. The last encounter they had with the rogues only one was able to survive. He even mentioned that they have strong Alpha&#39;s among them.  I couldn&#39;t think of anyone other than him who fits that description.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? Are you going to ignore me?&#34; I pulled a book on the shelves and throw it at him but he was able to catch it before it could even hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you always so harsh?&#34; He mumbled sounding a bit hurt. I just ignored him and left him in my room. When I opened the door Yustef was standing outside my door with a surprised look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our talk about last time about taking my blood back we never had a chance to talk to each other. Kariz was busy looking for ways to do the process with Clint which is surprisingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... I just want to ask if I could have a word with you for a moment?&#34; To be honest I also don&#39;t know how to act around them. Yes, I was with them for both my lives but things aren&#39;t the same anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just seeing them reminded me of the things I&#39;ve done to them. The memories of their cold bodice brushing in my skin as soon as I snatch they&#39;re hearts out of their own chest. Everyday it still hunts me, and there was the memory I had for being Klaire where they manipulated me to stop remembering my real identity. The feeling of being fear that one day I might end up hurting them and worst leading the once who are after me to them. Which turns out the one who are besides us was actually the one after me all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I understand why Clint and my father was trying so hard to hide me and let only Clint to be around the Elders. Being the only one to do the duties of the Royalties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow me.&#34; I mumbled, leading him down the staircase towards the back door where the old garden was resting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wild flowers started to take over the old roses, some of the roses are still here but the thorns around them are too thick. So it would hurt you if you end up getting too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down the old fountain which had no water in it. He sat next to me, it feel like how we used to do back on then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I don&#39;t want to feel this silence between us. It was only making it hard for me to keep up the cold front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just don&#39;t want everything between all of us to be like this. We all been together even before we remembered everything.&#34; He uttered, I don&#39;t wanna hear this kind of conversation. I put my hands up telling him to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to talk about the past. We all know that everything change. Nothing is completely the same anymore Yustef.&#34; I mumbled, he look hurt at my words but he have to know this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t let myself always be swayed by my emotions, this is also the reason why Kariz said I was still unstable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just that after we are finish with this, then we won&#39;t be able to stay by your side anymore.&#34; His words made my body stiffen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did I ever think that I would be able to still be around them if I was able to completely turned into a Lycan? A merciless beast that wouldn&#39;t think twice to kill them? I can&#39;t. Especially after knowing that they might be able to lost their wolf and became a normal human. Just thinking of their dead bodies in my hands made my stomach turns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t be.&#34; I muttered coldly, he didn&#39;t look surprised at my words. They are probably aware of this matter that they will lose everything they had after Belerick took everything to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but you can&#39;t stop us. You are still our princess.&#34; He smiled, then pat my head before walking away leaving me in the cold breeze of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you planning to do now?&#34; I turn around and found Galaz again. He was watching right at the top of the dead oak tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was planning on killing you right now. But you are not worth my time.&#34; I mutter, he jump off from the tree and stood beside me. How could this person be the standing Beta of Kariz?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even believe myself that I had such impression about him when I first met him. But after knowing him? I even doubt everything about him. He wasn&#39;t even serious about anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That hurts you know. But looks like another one is coming this way.&#34; Before I could even response he bid me farewell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at the direction he was pertaining to, and Clint was coming this. I bet Yustef called him and told him to talk to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw me staring at him his breathing become more intense like he was nervous or something? If we are still like before I would be laughing right now. Because my brother being nervous? Impossible! I would even believe it if someone said that the crows turns into white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; He mumbled, I swear I was stopping myself to laugh right now. He looks so awkward right now, like a little kid who was left to someone he just met for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brought you here?&#34; I will wouldn&#39;t make it easier to you Clint. I can still feel the pain of your manipulation. But still I did far more worst to them and that is why I wouldn&#39;t let myself be put into that situation again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... To be honest I don&#39;t know where to start.&#34; He uttered, scratching the back of his head. He really look adorable right now. My brother who is always been acting tough is now acting like a lost child in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Start from why did you hide it from me?&#34; He look surprised at my words. He turn his head down and start playing with his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t get myself to tell you everything, especially after you had your life in place. I thought I could protect you just like what Dad did but I failed. I failed you as Afreo and now I did it again and what&#39;s even worst is I was your own brother.&#34; I know and understand why he did what he did, but I can&#39;t just let myself forgive them from the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always wonder if I knew everything from the start maybe I could do something. Maybe things wouldn&#39;t get to this extent. And the pack members of the Central Kingdom wouldn&#39;t suffer like they did in the hands of the Faction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just remembering it made my blood boil, I know they weren&#39;t that good to me during those times that I was in the Central Kingdom but those are still my people that I swear to protect as Amara but now they are all gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still mad about hiding everything from me Clint, you know that your the only person that I trusted so much but then you broke it. If only I knew everything from the start then I could have done something. I could have save Dad from my own wrath. If I was able to gain control sooner then perhaps he wouldn&#39;t have  to die in my hands.&#34; He stood up and wipe my cheek. I didn&#39;t even notice my tears falling. I yank his hand away and harshly wipe my tears away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is also the reason why I didn&#39;t tell you. Because I know you will blame yourself from everything that happened. Klaire I know you wouldn&#39;t be able to forgive us from deceiving you but we just did what we think was the right thing to do. It was selfish yes. But we can&#39;t let your new life be ruined because of the past. You suffered so much before as Amara and now that you have a new life and was starting to live with it. We can&#39;t just let ourselves tell you everything and watch you be ruined again. I hope you forgive us, maybe not today but when time comes where your hatred is gone please remember that we are still your family.&#34; He wipe his tears away, it broke me to see him cry like this. After all he was my twin, my better half. Our bond may have been weakened because of the fact that I remember my past life but still the we spend together as siblings is still something that I cannot deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we were successful on returning everything to you and finish this war at once and by then you still wish for us to be gone from your life. Just say it and we will obliged. We took to much from you already and we wouldn&#39;t stop you for leaving a new life. Because I know deep inside you, being around us only reminds you of your previous life. And I do not wish you to live your life full of resentment and hatred to yourself. I wish to see you live your life like what you always wish for. Amara was tied and lock down into that dark place and we cannot do anything to save her from it but we won&#39;t let our Klaire to live that same dark place. You deserve to see the life outside. You deserve to smile and live a happy life. And with all our power, we will protect and make sure you live that life.&#34; I remain silent the whole time and just listen to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It might sound like I was bubbling nonsense here but I will protect you this time.&#34; He lean closer to me, I want to shove him away but I cannot let myself do it to him. He kissed the top of my head like he always do before leaving me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my head then my tears that I was holding on for too long came rushing down my eyes. I weep there like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done I just sat there in the coldness of the night. Galaz appear again out of nowhere and place a blanket in my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are more powerful than a super hero but still. We don&#39;t want you getting sick all of a sudden.&#34; He muttered, I just shake my head at him. He was joking again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that even if I&#39;m sick I will still be able to kill you right?&#34; He just laugh at my words and sat next to me. Looking at him, he had this dark features that matches a villain. Black hair, matching his black eyes. Something I couldn&#39;t even tell what is happening in that head of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really have your own way with your words don&#39;t you? And your welcome by the way.&#34; He mumbled while rolling his eyes. I couldn&#39;t stop myself but smile at how silly he could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah! Is the world about to end? Did you just smiled right now? Like for real? I was not imagining it right? What a life changing event.&#34; I smack him in his arms. He should stop exaggerating things so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shut up! Or leave me alone if you wouldn&#39;t shut up.&#34; He stop and pulled an invisible zipper in his mouth. I just shake my head at him with disbelief. And didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Galaz was really handsome to be honest. Unlike Dwayne who looks like a bright sunshine, Galaz was more like the cold night. Peaceful yet dangerous at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know he was always there beside me because Kariz told him to do so. He was guarding me for who knows what I might do. And I know that he was there watching me the whole time I was crying. But I simply thank him that he didn&#39;t ask anything about it and just let me have my peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are aware that Kariz was my brother right?&#34; I suddenly blurted out. He didn&#39;t seem surprised at my words. And nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was with him the whole time he was watching you from a far.&#34; He answered, I ignored his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you are with him when he took me.&#34; He avoided my gave and gave me a slight nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first I wasn&#39;t really aware that you are his sister. But during that time when you are in his captivity, I was still a child that time. It was just about the time where Kariz took me in.&#34; He explains. I didn&#39;t say anything,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t say that I wasn&#39;t mad at Kariz for everything he did but after knowing what he have been through. I was with him the whole time yet I wasn&#39;t able to protect him. My own younger brother, and now he was full of anger to the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look I&#39;m really sorry for not telling you everything sooner. But you know that I can&#39;t just violate Kariz&#39;s orders.&#34; Again I just remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does your sister looks like?&#34; He was surprised by my question but his eyes automatically soften upon hearing about his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some said she looks exactly like me? But I disagree, yes we have the same hair color and eyes but unlike me she was full of life. She always wanted to explore the world. We might be unfortunate when it comes to money but that didn&#39;t stop her from learning. She was really smart, always knowing what to do and giving advices. Sometimes I even wonder who was the older between us.&#34; He smiled upon recalling the memory he had with his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was really lucky to have a brother like you.&#34; I muttered, recalling my time with Clint and Kariz. Kariz and I only had little brother-sister interaction but with Clint. I couldn&#39;t help myself but smile at those memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope I could say that to myself. Because unlike the good brother she deserves I wasn&#39;t able to protect her. I couldn&#39;t do anything as I watch her being taken with tears in her eyes as she calls my name. I was nothing but pathetic.&#34; He said, clenching his fist until blood drips on his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that your sister wouldn&#39;t like seeing you hurting yourself. Especially after your scars are gone.&#34; I grabbed his wounded hand that have the mark of his claws and healed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that&#39;s better.&#34; I mumbled, I glance up and he was just staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; He look away in a hurry like I just caught him stealing something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-nothing... Thanks.&#34; He uttered shyly? Seriously? I narrow my brow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; I ask, he was acting a bit weird right now. He was the one who keeps acting casually to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said nothing, I was just surprised.&#34; He said then moving a bit away from me. Okay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever.&#34; I stood up and started heading inside. And for the first time he didn&#39;t follow me. He just remained in the same spot where we are earlier and he was mumbling something to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just shake my head and continue my way towards my room. But before I reach it I caught a glimpse of Ria and Yustef. Do they know each other? They look like they were talking about something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you do it?!&#34; That was Ria&#39;s voice. I still want to listen to them but Ali was heading my way, which is towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know why but I grabbed Ali and pulled him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait what are you doing?&#34; I ignored him and pulled him outside. Just what on earth am I doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Train with me.&#34; I couldn&#39;t think of any other excuse and just blurted out the first thing that comes to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I just got here and you want me to be your sparring partner? Just where is Galaz?&#34; I ignored his words and stop right at the open area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know where he was, and come on. I want some change of phase.&#34; I mumbled, he just stood there and let out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, but only two rounds. Because I have to handle something early in the morning.&#34; I nodded my head. And he ready himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh by the way, no one is allowed to use their abilities.&#34; He added, I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be needing to use them anyway.&#34; I mutter and he stared at me with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I know why Galaz was stuck with you.&#34; He smirk back. I have no idea what he meant by that but started attacking him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fast enough to dodge my every attack. I can say that he was really something. Kariz really choose his people wisely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now it&#39;s my turn.&#34; He then tried to kick me but I was able to caught it in time and twisted him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oops.&#34; I uttered, he fell to the ground with a loud thug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I still want to get back to you but it looks like Kariz was waiting for me.&#34; I turn around and found Kariz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time then.&#34; I muttered, he nodded his head and stood up. Brushing off the dust in his clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, next time.&#34;</p>
