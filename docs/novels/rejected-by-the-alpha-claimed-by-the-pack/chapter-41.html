                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with those poisonous snakes, beasts, and monsters, I was in a situation I had never been in before. Alpha shifted in front of me. Gray fur covered his entire body. He stared at me with scarlet eyes. Behind me, Beta and Gordon let out a warning growl from their throats. They surrounded me, waiting for the moment when I exposed my flaws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t wait for them to attack me together! I grabbed at Andre&#39;s face. When my claws reached in front of his eyes, he could not avoid them. He could only sacrifice his left hand to protect his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was fighting with Andre, Gordon bit through my left shoulder from behind. I grabbed his head and threw him off my back to the ground. Then he quickly stood up and raised his claws to attack me with Andre. I blocked Gordon&#39;s attack and scratched his palm. However, Andre&#39;s claws stabbed into my chest. I could only turn around slightly to avoid him piercing through my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre&#39;s huge claws broke my ribs and opened a hole in my lungs. I wanted to jump out of the window, but Gordon grabbed my ankle and pulled me to the ground. His claws went through the flesh and directly pierced the joint of my ankle. I endured the tearing pain and pulled my feet out of his claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost fainted because of the pain and blood loss, and Nicole was also exhausted. Andre and Gordon forced me into a corner, and they would end my life in the next second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even if I died, I had to pull them with me. This was what they owed my parents. Using the power of the witches, I would curse them to die in regret at the cost of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I made up my mind to say the spell, a deep breath of death enveloped all of us, and Andre also stopped moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Claudia screaming in my mind. This was very bad. Caesar immediately locked her position through the smell. The closer I got to her, the more I could smell her blood. Besides her, I could also smell other people&#39;s blood. What exactly happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I rushed into the room, I only saw that Claudia was covered in blood. There was a big hole in her chest. Andre and Gordon blocked her in the corner and wanted to kill her. The desire to kill swallowed my thoughts. I could not control myself and became a wolf. They also saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre and Gordon pounced on me. I dodged their attacks. The smell of Claudia&#39;s blood made me angry. I threw Gordon on the wall, and small cracks appeared on the wall. Gordon slid down from the wall to the ground. I stepped on Gordon&#39;s neck. He could not make a sound and could only helplessly grab my leg with his claws. He tore off a large piece of flesh from my shank, but I didn&#39;t care. His movements slowly became weak. I could feel that he was about to die under my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre launched another sneak attack from behind me. I lifted Gordon up from the ground and threw him on Andre. Andre pushed Gordon away from him. He was going to run away. I didn&#39;t intend to give him a chance to call for help. But Claudia let out a weak voice that made me stop. I quickly knelt beside her and heard her intermittently breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia, can you still hear me?&#34; She was already unconscious. I carefully picked her up and tried not to touch any of her wounds. I needed to rush to the hospital as fast as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put her down!&#34; The doctor ordered me. He was already used to this kind of scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to put her on the bed, but Caesar and I were fighting for control. After seeing that Claudia was seriously injured, he did not trust anyone now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She is mine!&#39; I was sure that he shouted this and used my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;But she is going to die!&#39; I hoped that we were still mate, so that I could personally heal Claudia&#39;s wounds and not quarrel with a furious wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced Caesar to let go. The heaviest wound on Claudia&#39;s body had not yet been healed. It was the hole in her chest. It looked very shocking. &#39;Let her go! Let her be treated!&#39; Caesar roared in dissatisfaction, but he still gently placed her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I sent Claudia into the emergency room, but my heart was still beating wildly. When I thought that I might lose Claudia, my stomach felt like it had been punched. This thought made me want to vomit, but now I could only sit at the door and wait for the doctor&#39;s verdict. A nurse stopped not far away from me. She looked at me and hesitated to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be afraid and stammered, &#34;Do you need to treat your wound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that I looked down and saw that my leg was still dripping blood as the wound that had healed was immediately torn again because I ran with Claudia in my arms. &#34;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;ll heal.&#34; It was a small wound for me. I just wanted to wait for Claudia&#39;s news now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long wait, the doctor walked out of the emergency room. He told me that Claudia was out of danger now, but she still needed to transfusion and rest. I sat by the bed and looked at Claudia who was still in a coma. Her face became pale because of blood loss. I held her hand, hoping to pass a little warmth to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked on a snowy land, barefoot. The huge blizzard wrapped around me, and I could only hug myself to get some warmth. There was a grey-black wolf biting the corner of my clothes, and I stopped. He rubbed his nose against my hand. I hugged him tightly. There was a feeling I was very familiar with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only have you now.&#34; I buried my face in the wolf&#39;s fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made a noise to drag me somewhere and I followed him for a long time. &#34;I can&#39;t walk, it was too cold.&#34; But the wolf still dragged me, and whenever I stopped, he would circle around me, looking anxious. Until we reached a deep lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to jump in? But it looks cold.&#34; The wolf insisted on dragging me into the lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. I really believe you for no reason.&#34; I jumped into the lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up from the coma, my whole body was cold from blood loss. Beside my bed, Isaac held my left hand and fell asleep. He lowered his head, and there was a lot of blood on his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac?&#34; My voice sounded hoarse, unlike myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here. How do you feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have I been unconscious? Where are Andre and Gordon?&#34; I struggled to get up, but Isaac pressed me back to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced at his watch. &#34;About ten hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are they in a hurry to kill you?&#34; Isaac asked me eagerly, &#34;I know you might not want to say it, but it is related to your safety. I will protect you.&#34; He looked at me sincerely. I could not lie to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I heard their secret. They killed my parents. My parents are not traitors! Do you remember the war about ten years ago? At that time, Alpha died unexpectedly, and my parents were executed as traitors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I remember. Andre became our pack&#39;s Alpha from that time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In order to seize power, Andre poisoned the former Alpha&#39;s whole family and framed my parents!&#34; I clenched the sheets tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bastard! When you get better, I will let them get the punishment they deserve.&#34; Isaac did not hesitate. His words were like a guarantee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you believe what I said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I have always believed in you. Whether it was two years ago or now.&#34; I looked into his golden-brown eyes. There was no need to read his mind at all. I knew what he said was true. Just like before, he was the only one who believed what I said and believed that my parents were not traitors. What a sincere and clumsy wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a warm current flowing into my heart, my body slowly became warm. I looked at Isaac, his face full of surprise. He held me in his arms, and I could feel our souls merging together. The mate link between us was reconnected. After two years, our empty souls were finally mended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac kissed my forehead. &#34;Welcome back, my mate.&#34;</p>
