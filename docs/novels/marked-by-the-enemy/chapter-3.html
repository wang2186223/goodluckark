                <p>Thirst</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For several minutes I tried to not stare at Nero. But of course, I ended up doing that a couple of times and felt annoyed that I was doing so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But every time his voice echoed into my ears, I felt a strong sensation, almost like I was drawn to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! It was like a part of me was drawn to professor Fang, and I couldn&#39;t put it in words, but something about him just kept me nervous and yet aroused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the weirdest feeling and yet, I was drowning in it each time our gaze met or I heard his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes kept dragging back towards his lips each time I pulled them away from him, and when Nero locked eyes with me, I swallowed hard even though it wasn&#39;t quenching the thirst that I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of minutes into the lecture, I began to notice that my classmates were staring at me, and not in the usual provoking way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their stares were pissing me off. But I sighed only, knowing one word for me and I would have dug myself a six feet hole for them to bury me in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I did what I always do to take my mind off things. I took out my copybook and started sketching terrible drawings of my classmates, striving to maintain my calm expression although my anger was growing like a rising storm that I couldn&#39;t control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after distracting myself by doing more sketches, I could still feel their eyes on me, and I felt like I was on my last straw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by my rage which always makes me act like a daredevil, I stood up, sluggishly stuffed my things back into my bag, and then gazed at Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I be excused from class!&#34; I boldly uttered, gazing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Nero stated without hesitating as he arched his eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I don&#39;t need a disruption in my class, and I don&#39;t care what excuse you have! You can not treat my class like the street by leaving and coming into this room at any time you please! So sit back down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the faint giggles echoing in the room, I felt the weight of embarrassment smashed against my shoulder, and I gazed down at the tiles, breathing in deep to suppress the storm that fought against my control to be let loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is he acting like such an ass! I get that he has a reputation to uphold or whatever. But all I was asking was to leave his class, and he was acting so difficult about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard the lecturer! Sit back down, you weirdo!&#34; Someone shouted from the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a freak!&#34; Another jerk shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughters echoed in the classroom, and I stood there taking it all in like always even though I wanted to shut them up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you are so funny with your stupid ass jokes! Well, newsflash, you are not, so shut up!&#34;  Nero harshly said, and my face went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I didn&#39;t know if it was okay to call him a scalawag or not because it seemed like he was actually standing up for me, and no one had ever done that for me in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a few seconds, and then the class grew silent. But Nero was still staring at me, and I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off him, almost like a force was keeping me from looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit down! I won&#39;t tell you again!&#34;  Nero said, frowning at me before staring the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed by his tone, I threw my bag over my shoulder and harshly uttered, &#34;And if I don&#39;t?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can leave and drop my class because if you think about staying here and upholding such an ill-bred attitude, expect an F at the end of the semester.&#34; He uttered without even looking my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden silence in the room left me feeling more embarrassed to sit down, even though I knew I had to because my father would kill me if I failed a course again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please take your seat,&#34; Nero suddenly said, meeting my eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he focused on the tablet in his hand and calmly uttered, &#34;Okay, everyone, turn to chapter five of your textbook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds of hesitation, I carelessly dropped my backpack on the desk and rested my head on my bag, shutting my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I heard a student behind me mumble, &#34;So are we supposed to pretend that Mr. Fang&#39;s pants and Blake&#39;s blazer are not a matching set?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud groan escaped my lips, realizing that things just got a bit complicated, and I hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally raised my eyelids, I saw that the chair by me was empty. Immediately, I raised my head and darted my eyes around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then reality finally slapped me in my face. I had slept through Mr. Fang&#39;s entire lecture. Well, this was one way to get on his bad side and have him hate me even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I screwed that thought for a moment because as I turned my head to the front of the classroom, I saw a bitch that I hate so much and her loyal followers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father is a powerful wolf that even my father respected, and I knew not to cross her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the class was over, the fact that she was still in the room meant trouble was coming my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I kept a calm expression even after learning that, and grabbed my bag, throwing it on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the front of the class, she blocked my way, yet I kept a calm expression and mumbled, &#34;Good afternoon, Karen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is something going on between Mr. Fang and you?&#34; Karen harshly asked, scowling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! He&#39;s a new instructor, and according to his introduction speech, he just arrived in the state, so how can there be something between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how did you get his blazer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, I tried to figure out what to say. But one thing I was sure about was that I couldn&#39;t tell them the whole truth because I knew that it would only make matters worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was bleeding, and he lent me his blazer because he knew that my sweater got ruined from the bloodstain on it!&#34; I calmly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I gave a stiff smile and said, &#34;Can I leave now? I need to catch the bus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response from them, I walked away. But Karen suddenly grabbed me by my hair and yanked me in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in my scalp burned badly. But I wasn&#39;t willing to show it on my face and make myself look more pathetic than I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Karen then stabbed her finger on my chest and said, &#34;You lying bitch! I will give you one more chance, to tell the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about,&#34; I mumbled, striving to walk past Karen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she kept moving in the direction I was going in while smiling mockingly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little hoe! Someone saw you going into the men&#39;s bathroom, and later on, Mr. Fang came out without his blazer. Guess who had it on, coming out of the bathroom just a few minutes after he did?&#34; Karen said, putting her hands on her hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you think happened, it didn&#39;t happen,&#34; I said, struggling against my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scowling, Karen hit her fingertip on my chest and said, &#34;Another lie! Do you think we don&#39;t know what you are doing by throwing yourself at our instructor! Your father might be our pack leader, but you don&#39;t have a shot with anyone here because you are weak and worthless, so you are going for the new guy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s the stupidest assumption I have ever heard! You can&#39;t be that dumb!&#34; I blurted out without thinking for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Karen rushed to me and lifted me by my neck, slamming me to the ground before I could get the chance to process what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were blue when I looked into them, and that only happens to werewolves who have taken an &#34;innocent life,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow from Karen&#39;s attack left me in a confused state for a second as I lay on the cold tile while the pain tore through my back and my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I guess I will be spending a month in &#39;the night&#39; after all.&#39; That was my only thought as I coughed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I raised my gaze and saw Karen and the other girl coldly staring down at me, and I just knew what was coming next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to enjoy this as much as it is going to hurt you!&#34; Karen coldly uttered with a smirk on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing the smug smile, she reached down, entangled her fingers with my hair, and dragged me against the tiles before swinging me towards the desks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my stomach slammed into the pointed edge of a chair, I immediately threw out blood before dropping down to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you can heal quickly, I will make sure to give you enough bruises, so as they take their time to heal, you will remember where your place is, and stay away from professor Fang!&#34; Karen said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Why did I have to get the healing part of a wolf and not the strength! Ahah, this sucks so bad!&#39; Was my only thought when I felt Karen&#39;s fingers tighten in my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I closed my eyelids and allowed myself to drown in the agony as I felt my head slam against the tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karen, I think you went too far! She looks hurt pretty badly!&#34; I heard a honeyed voice say, and after listening to the fear in her tone, I forced my eyes open despite the pain circulating in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although my left eye was a bit blurry, I could still see the anxious look on Karen&#39;s face when she said, &#34;Let&#39;s get out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I could hear the sound of footsteps hurrying out of the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it suddenly grew silent, and the only thought on my mind was, &#34;Dad is going to be so mad if I miss the bus and go home late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I felt numb, lying in my blood, and even though a part of me wanted to lay there for a while until I healed, I knew that I couldn&#39;t miss the bus. So I struggled to stand on my feet, and I finally succeeded after the fourth attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But, within a split second, my legs collapsed underneath me, and I dropped to the floor, hitting my head hard against the tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?!&#34; were the last words I heard before I lost consciousness.</p>
