                <p>Sally&#39;s body began to tremble as she held the stone in her hands, the force of Desdemona&#39;s will crushing over her. She heard a voice in her mind whispering to drop the stone, give in, come to her. Sally squeezed her eyes shut as she fought the compulsion. She felt her knees begin to weaken, but before she could collapse, strong arms wrapped around her. She didn&#39;t have to open her eyes to know who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued to fight, to push back. &#34;You will not win,&#34; she responded to the whispers, to the evil that tried to flow over her skin like slick oil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally, healer from another land. You will be mine, your blood will sustain my power. I will watch the life fade from your eyes as I cut your beating heart from your chest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice scraped against her mind as Sally struggled with the images the witch projected. She felt wetness on her face - tears were running from her eyes. It wasn&#39;t supposed to end like this, evil wasn&#39;t supposed to escape. She felt a gut-wrenching pull inside her and let out a scream as she pushed back. A flash of light pierced the night and then all was still. The wind stopped, the snow ceased to fall, and the silent night wrapped itself around the quieted battle field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally opened her eyes slowly and tried to gain her bearings. She looked over her shoulder into deep hazel eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got you, Sally mine,&#34; Costin whispered into her ear. Sally didn&#39;t fight him, but turned into his embrace and let his warmth comfort her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t supposed to end like this Costin. She got away. She won.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, hush. She didn&#39;t win. She bought herself a reprieve, nothing more.&#34; Costin stroked her hair gently and held her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri stepped up to Sally with Rachel at her side. &#34;You did well, young healer. Desdemona is strong. She will be back and we must be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are we going to do?&#34; Sally asked as she raised her head from Costin&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only thing we can,&#34; Peri told her firmly. &#34;Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to head back to the tavern with the other females,&#34; Decebel told Jen as she nuzzled his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vasile and I need to deal with the Serbian pack. I will let you know what happens when we are done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen narrowed her eyes at him, knowing something was up, but he wasn&#39;t spilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, keep your secrets. Just remember,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t write a check your pretty hide can&#39;t cash, Jennifer,&#34; Decebel interrupted his irritated mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen turned from him with a snort and followed Jacque as they caught up with Alina and the others. Vasile had given his mate the same orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel watched his mate leave with the others and had to hold himself back from following. He didn&#39;t like letting her out of his sight, needing to make sure she was okay after the brutality she had just endured, but the Serbian pack had to be dealt with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over to Vasile and they both phased back into their human forms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is the highest-ranking pack member alive in the Serbian pack?&#34; Vasile&#39;s voice boomed across the field. One by one, the Serbian wolves moved toward Vasile and began to phase back into human form. When they were all standing in front of Vasile and Decebel, they all knelt as one, all except a large, dark haired man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was fifth in the pack rankings, Alpha,&#34; the wolf responded without looking at Vasile. He stared at the ground instead. Decebel watched the wolf&#39;s body language and it was apparent that he was not dominant enough to lead a pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf stepped forward toward Decebel and knelt, he bared his neck and briefly met his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You defeated our Alpha, your pack defeated our top four. We owe you fealty and submit to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel&#39;s jaw dropped, but he composed himself quickly. He looked at Vasile, who didn&#39;t look surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is the old way. You defeated their Alpha, technically you are now their Alpha,&#34; Vasile told him. Decebel was unable to read the emotion on his Alpha&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; Decebel asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate to lose you as my Beta, but you were destined to be an Alpha. And we cannot ignore the benefit of having such a strong alliance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel understood that Vasile had to look at how this would affect and benefit their species. Decebel hadn&#39;t even considered being the Alpha of a pack again. He was content as Beta, even if submitting to Vasile did not always settle well with his wolf. He looked out over the kneeling wolves. They looked broken and lost. They needed a leader.  They needed someone who would care for them properly, someone to bring their pack back together. Decebel could do that. And he had just taken a woman as his mate who was more than capable to assist him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are there any who will challenge me?&#34; Decebel asked the wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, they averted their eyes in submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not like Thad. If I&#39;m to be your Alpha there will be changes, there will be drastic changes. I will not tolerate division, or disloyalty. I will not tolerate mutiny or cruelty or hatred. You will be unified, you will treat your pack mates as well as other packs with respect. You will submit to me and my mate. If you cannot do this, you will be banished from this pack. Am I clear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As one they answered, &#34;As you say, so shall it be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel stepped toward the kneeling man in front of him. &#34;Your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drake, Alpha,&#34; the man responded quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drake, tonight I will ask you to gather our pack.&#34; Decebel used the word &#34;our&#34; to immediately establish ownership and let them know he would take care of them. &#34;Follow us back to the tavern. We will discuss in more detail where we go from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded once and stood, turning back to the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel turned to Vasile, trusting Drake to do as he was instructed. &#34;Well, this is not exactly how I expected my evening to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vasile chuckled. &#34;Well, you&#39;re alive, your mate is alive and, for now, we have triumphed. It could be worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t celebrate just yet. I have to tell my mate that she has just become Alpha of a broken pack.&#34; Decebel turned with Vasile, heading back in the direction of the forest and the tavern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think by now you should know that Jen likes a challenge - thrives on them. She mated you, after all.&#34; Vasile lunged into his phase before Decebel could respond and Decebel followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you?&#34; Decebel asked Jen as they lay on their bed. Two days had passed since the battlefield, since Decebel had dropped in Jen&#39;s lap that they had just inherited a pack. They&#39;d made it back to the Romanian pack mansion and in a few days&#39;, time would be heading to the Serbian pack headquarters to discuss the changes that were coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just a lot to take in, Dec,&#34; Jen told him as she traced the markings on his bare chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can understand that. Are you upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Apprehensive, unsure, somewhere between freaking out and laughing - yes.&#34; Jen smiled at him despite her words. &#34;I know we&#39;ve talked about the why of doing this. I know it&#39;s what&#39;s best, but what&#39;s best doesn&#39;t always mean easy. In fact, the two aren&#39;t usually friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel smiled at her and pulled her closer. He kissed the top of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have another issue to deal with,&#34; Jen told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally,&#34; Decebel murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she doesn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, she turns eighteen tomorrow, doesn&#39;t she? Seems like she&#39;s getting ready to know whether she wants to or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacque and I talked about it with Peri and agreed that we think it&#39;s something we should tell her privately and you and Vasile should talk to Costin, seeing as how he has taken a keen interest in my girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel raised a single eyebrow at his mate. &#34;You and Jacque decided this, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yep. So, you might want to grow a -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel growled, &#34;Do not finish that sentence, mate of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen winked at him as she stood up, pulling from his embrace. &#34;I&#39;m just trying to help you get ready to drop the bomb on Costin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel snorted. &#34;I think I&#39;m perfectly capable of talking with a pack mate without you telling me to grow a pair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Why do you get to say it? It takes all the umph from it when you say it,&#34; she pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel stood up as he laughed and pulled her into his arms. &#34;Ahh, my sweet, sweet love. What am I going to do about that mouth of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you seriously just ask me that, B?&#34; Jen pulled back and smiled at him wickedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did just walk right into that one, didn&#39;t I?&#34; he asked sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, my love, that one was all you.&#34; She took him by the hand and pulled him toward the door. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go let the lovebirds know that, unbeknownst to them, they are indeed lovebirds, or wolves, or whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally, my dear, we need to talk,&#34; Jacque announced dramatically as she entered Sally&#39;s room without knocking, Jen right on her heels, and Peri behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Jacque, you may come in. Thank you for knocking,&#34; Sally said sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Man, this whole gypsy healer thing has given you some back bone, Sal. I&#39;m digging it.&#34; Jen winked at her and laid down on the bed next to where she sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s this big news?&#34; Sally asked, looking each of her friends pointedly, then ending up looking at Peri, who she figured had the information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brace yourself, Thelma,&#34; Jen muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri stepped forward. &#34;There is something about healers that we haven&#39;t told you yet. I didn&#39;t think you needed to know until you were 18, since it really wouldn&#39;t affect you until then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally watched Peri closely but didn&#39;t interrupt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally, healers are mates to Canis lupus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally&#39;s mouth dropped open. Her eyes widened in shock. After several moments of opening and closing her mouth, she finally found her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean they can?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I mean they do,&#34; Peri said firmly. &#34;A gypsy healer is always a true mate to a Canis lupus. The bond doesn&#39;t present itself until the healer turns 18 and is around said Canis lupus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re saying I will be someone&#39;s true mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come now, Sally dear, don&#39;t be obtuse. We know there has been a certain fur ball sniffing around you.&#34; Jacque smacked Jen&#39;s arm at her lack of tact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen snarled. &#34;I&#39;m just telling it like it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally stood up abruptly. &#34;You think Costin is my mate?&#34; She couldn&#39;t believe the words were coming out of her mouth and she couldn&#39;t believe the relief that seeped into her bones at the possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally, he hasn&#39;t been able to take his eyes off you the past month. He is constantly with you. Seriously, how could you not notice his interest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t notice, I just thought with everything going on that emotions were high and whatnot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, well, it&#39;s the whatnot that we&#39;re going with here,&#34; Jen said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Costin doesn&#39;t know this information, or didn&#39;t know. Decebel and Vasile are speaking with him now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally&#39;s head snapped around at Peri&#39;s words. &#34;They&#39;re telling him now?&#34; her voice rose as she began to process the information. Costin was being told that Sally was possibly his mate. What if he was horrified at the idea? What if he really didn&#39;t think of her that way and he had just been being nice the past month because her friends had been going through such horrible things? Sally lowered her head and covered her face with her hands. She didn&#39;t think her heart could handle Costin&#39;s rejection. She wasn&#39;t strong and resilient like Jen or Jacque. She was already falling for Costin and, as she&#39;d predicted, he had the ability to tear her heart out. The thought of him doing it was actually more painful than the threat she&#39;d received from the witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sally stood there with her hands in her face - thoughts, worries, fears running through her mind - she nearly jumped out of her skin when, once again, her door flew open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to speak with Sally.&#34; Sally&#39;s heart plummeted into her stomach at the sound of his voice. Costin&#39;s words were firm, and not a request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally turned to look at him - the intensity in his eyes had her taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; he told her as he stepped toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen, Jacque, and Peri began to make their way to the door. Jen stopped next to Costin and looked him in the eye. &#34;Hurt her and there is nowhere you will be able to go that I won&#39;t find you, and when I do, I will do unspeakable things. Got me?&#34; She raised her eyebrows in challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin&#39;s eyes widened. He looked from Jen to Sally and then Jacque.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque wrapped an arm around Jen&#39;s shoulders, tugging her along as she smiled at Costin, &#34;We know she&#39;s disturbed, Costin. Believe me, we&#39;ve tried to get her help. But I will help her do those unspeakable things if you hurt our girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin nodded once, acknowledging their words. When the door closed, he looked back to Sally and stepped closer. Sally didn&#39;t move. Costin raised a hand and cupped her face gently. Their bodies were now only inches apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally mine,&#34; his voice was a whispered caress across her face, &#34;I think maybe we have a few small things to talk about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally let out a very unladylike snort, &#34;I think that&#39;s an understatement. A &#39;few small things&#39;? Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin&#39;s lips twitched at the exasperation in her voice. &#34;Yeah, just a couple of small details. Ring size, do you prefer boxers, briefs, boxer briefs. You know, minor details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally&#39;s jaw dropped open at Costin&#39;s words, which only made the wolf in front of her stretch a wide grin across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told you, Sally. You are mine. Once you get that major detail into that sharp mind of yours, the rest will be child&#39;s play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally didn&#39;t know what to say. She stood there, looking into the most beautiful hazel eyes she had ever seen, and wanted to pinch herself to make sure she was awake. She was his. That&#39;s what he had said -she was his. Sally&#39;s head cocked to the side as she considered that thought. Her eyes narrowed as she continued to look at Costin&#39;s too-beautiful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;m yours,&#34; she paused and licked her lips nervously, &#34;that means -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin wrapped an arm around her waist pulling a gasp from her as he wrapped the hand that had been cupping her face around the nape of her neck possessively. He pressed his forehead to hers and smiled when her breaths quickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re mine, beautiful healer, which means I&#39;m yours,&#34; Costin told her firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally tried to slow her breathing, but feeling him so close, the intensity and the confidence in his words - it was all overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh boy,&#34; she finally got out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, sweet Sally mine, now that is an understatement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Epilogue</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen watched Decebel as he spoke to the Serbian pack. The confidence he wore like the most comfortable pair of jeans was intoxicating. She should be paying attention to what he was saying, but her man was hot and that was distracting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can hear you, you know?&#34; She heard the smile in his voice as he spoke through their bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like it&#39;s news to you. You know I drool over you on a regular basis.&#34; Jen rolled her eyes when he looked up at her from where he stood. She froze when his eyes began to glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Decebel, you can&#39;t look at me like that in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? You&#39;re mine. Do you need a reminder?&#34; He raised a single eyebrow at her in challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, she turned and walked away, knowing it would drive him crazy. She made a beeline for the room they had claimed in the new mansion that the Serbian pack - her pack - had taken up residence in. It had been only two weeks since the battle, or WWF, as she and Jacque were calling it - Wars with Fur Balls. One thing she had learned, the fur balls didn&#39;t play when stuff needed to get done. Things had been moving quickly since it was decided that Decebel would be Alpha of the Serbian pack. They had decided a fresh start was needed and sold the previous pack mansion. They bought a new one on some land that was much closer to the Romanian pack, which was something Jen had pushed for. So far everyone had been very nice. A little timid, but the vibes that Jen was getting were those of relief. It was like the Serbian pack had been starved for affection and safety, and constantly drenched in fear. They had not respected Thad, they had followed him only out of fear, or at least the surviving wolves had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel had made it very clear that he was their Alpha and he would protect them, provide for them when they needed, and teach them to thrive. Jen was still nervous, but excited at the same time. Rachel had been over helping Jen meet the other females and get things settled. It was still up in the air who Decebel&#39;s Beta would be and which healer would come to their pack. So many decisions to be made, so many difficult things ahead of them. But, as Jen walked down the long corridor toward the room Decebel and she had claimed, the only thing she could think of was her mate and how much she needed to be in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d nearly made it to the door when a strong arm swept her off her feet. She let out a breathless laugh as Decebel swung their door open and slammed it behind him. He tossed her on their king-sized bed and let out a low growl when she bounced up onto her hands and knees, ready to jump away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jennifer,&#34; he growled in warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Alpha?&#34; Jen&#39;s words dripped with sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me chase you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh, but you love the chase.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved slowly toward the bed and Jen saw something in his eyes that gave her pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not tonight, baby. Tonight, I need you right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen walked on her knees to the edge of the bed, meeting him there. He wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All you have to do is tell me. Whatever you need, Dec, it&#39;s yours.&#34; Jen leaned forward and kissed him gently on the lips. She could see the worry in the lines on his face and the stress that tensed his muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just need you, Jennifer. Always you.&#34; He kissed her possessively, firmly letting her know she was his and he was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All yours, my love,&#34; Jen whispered in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you for loving me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen pulled back, startled by his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like it&#39;s a hardship,&#34; she teased, then sobered. &#34;You&#39;re the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me, Dec. Never doubt that. Never doubt my love for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea how much you mean to me, how much joy you have brought to my life.&#34; He stepped back from her and walked to the bedside table. Pulling open a drawer, he looked over his shoulder at her. &#34;I have something for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen smiled. &#34;For me?&#34; she asked brightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. He pulled out a small, white velvet box. Jen&#39;s breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t exactly prepared when we bonded and married, so I didn&#39;t have this to give you. You wear my marks on your skin, you bear my bite on your beautiful neck. Now I would ask you to wear one more thing to show the world you are mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Decebel, I&#39;m like a walking billboard for you, my sweet fur ball.&#34; She couldn&#39;t hide her excitement at the sight of the little box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat on the bed and pulled her into his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is for you, my precious one,&#34; he whispered as he handed her the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen held her breath as she pulled the lid up, the hinges stiff with newness. She let out a small whimper at the sight before her. She looked up into his eyes and, to her surprise, they were moist with unshed tears. Her own weren&#39;t so shy as they rolled down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, it&#39;s perfect.&#34; Her voice was soft as she pulled the ring from its cushioned resting place. He took the ring from her and gently slipped it on her left ring finger. Jen held it out to examine it. It wrapped around her finger like a vine, with all the matching points of the markings on her skin. Decebel had had a platinum ring made in a replica to the marks on their skin, marks that would fit together like a puzzle piece, completing the design the way Decebel completed Jen and the way Jen completed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what the future holds, Dec. I know it&#39;s going to be rough and dangerous and filled with tons of smart-ass comments via yours truly. But as long as you will stand with me, as long as you are here with me, I can deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel smiled at his mouthy, blunt, yet fiercely loyal mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is nothing in this life or the next that can keep me from your side.&#34; Decebel&#39;s lips were so close to hers that they brushed when he spoke. &#34;I love you, Jennifer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen closed her eyes as she let his words pour over her and through her. She pressed her lips to his and let her actions speak for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their life together was just beginning and the world of the Canis lupus was changing. Jen had defeated death and fate would demand a price; a powerful Alpha had been defeated and a new one instated; an evil witch was on the loose with a vendetta on her hands; history was seeping its way up through the dusty cracks of time, the result of which was a mystery yet to come. They were preparing for the worst, just as Peri had said - preparing for the worst, hoping for the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight, tonight the world could wait. Tonight, was for them. A time to forget the fears and worries, and remember that they had walked through the darkness and it had not defeated them. They had come out of the darkness together, emerging whole on the other side.</p>
