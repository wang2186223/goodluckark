                <p>When I got to her room door, I knocked since she locked it, and I called out, &#34;Blake, open the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Nero, can you not do this, not now!&#34; Blake shouted, and I could hear her pounding heartbeat just on the other side of the door.</p>

                <p>&#34;Nothing. I made the decision on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honesty, Blake. I need only that from you right now. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It fell silent, and I waited impatiently staring at the door. Then her voice suddenly echoed out, &#34;I told you Nero, if not another powerful alpha, it&#39;s going to be Killian. And I am okay with it being him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Open the door, Blake.&#34; I said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I want you to look me in the eyes and tell me those words again. If I believe you, I will let you be with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly the door opened, and Blake&#39;s head popped out, eyeing me for a moment before opening it wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, I walked past Blake, entered the room, and sat down on her bed, focusing on her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m listening,&#34; I told her as she stood by the open door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm Okay so as I was say-ing Kill-ian&#34; Blake mumbled, pouting at me. &#34;Can you stop staring into my eyes like that! You are making me nervous to speak clearly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your last words just now seem fine to me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m intimidating you.&#34; I let out, waking from the bed. &#34;You want to know what I think&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without taking a step, Blake&#39;s eyes remained glued to mine as I approached her. Then I shut the door and focus on her stiff face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want to be with Killain, but Loki is holding something over your head, and that&#39;s what have you making such a dumb decision.&#34; I let out, studying her as she flittered her gaze. &#34;What does he have on you, Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about you?&#34; Blake whispered. &#34;Do you want to be with Luna? Or is there another reason you are with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason and I talked,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question was on the tip of my tongue. But I hold back my words, already knowing what he might have told Blake for her to say such words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Luna your mate, Nero?!&#34; Blake asked, raising her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Jason and you talk, shouldn&#39;t you have your answer by now?!&#34; I mumbled, feeling pissed at that Judas for his nonsense interference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t have my answer because I want to hear it from you! What is your intention with Luna?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something that is none of your business!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right! Then it&#39;s none of your damn business why I&#39;m deciding to bear Killian&#39;s mark!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger sparked in me, and I slapped the door, caging Blake in between my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got one choice, and that is to leave here with Jason, and go start over with your life somewhere fancy, and leave this mess behind,&#34; I uttered, struggling against my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her eyes fixed on mine, Blake clenched her jaw and then boldly uttered, &#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had that stubborn look on her face that told me that she didn&#39;t give a shit about what I wanted and will go ahead and do whatever the hell she wants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I mumbled, regretting the next words that came to my mind. &#34;Option number two, you want another powerful alpha? Okay, you can bear my mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want that either,&#34; Blake whispered in a choked voice with tears brimming in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it&#39;s not genuine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Nero. Can you look me in the eyes and tell me that without hesitating?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving me the chance to respond, she blurted out, &#34;No, you can&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it better to use me for whatever you want from Loki, instead of some dipstick!&#34; I mumbled in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Because you said the word, &#39;Use!&#39; I want you, Nero! Not to use you! But because it&#39;s what I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! I want you too, Blake! There! You have it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It immediately grew silent between us as she furrowed her brow, glaring at me, and I stood there like some fool, wondering what the heck I was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34; Blake whispered, her face soaked with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!?&#34; I asked in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, don&#39;t make things worse by lying. It will just make me feel more pathetic than I already do now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The immediate look on Blake&#39;s face told me that I could repeat those words over and over, and she will still doubt it every single time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I whispered, withdrawing my hands from the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s Killian or rejecting her later on, and right now, I rather she is safe and hates me in the long run, than to give her to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into her eyes, I reached for her blouse button and started unbuttoning it, observing the shift in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to bear my mark, and I&#39;m okay with everyone knowing that you are mine,&#34; I told her when she looked down at my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I say I don&#39;t want to?&#34; Blake whispered, looking back at my eyes indecisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will still do it,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it&#39;s either I mark you or kill Killian. Your choice,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling her blouse off her shoulders, I smirked and mumbled, &#34;You want to put my words to a test?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long pause as Blake gazed at me. Then she reached for my shirt edge and tiptoed to pull it upward, struggling to get it past my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing Blake by the waist, I lifted her off the ground, and carried her to the bed, dropping her on the mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she stared at me, eyes all wet and dazed as I took out my shirt made me even more aroused by her. She is the only one who has had such a crazy influence on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting rid of the only things covering our bare skins, I made myself the bottom, placing Blake at the top of me, locking eyes with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed scared by the position I put her in, and her palm pressed flat against my chest as she wiggled her legs, squeezing her eyes shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it uncomfortable?&#34; I mumbled, feeling her hips slowly move downward as I held her by the waists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my first time in such a position. You usually do all the moving, so I&#39;m not sure how to go about this.&#34; Blake whispered, opening one of her eyes. &#34;Also, why do I feel tighter in this way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, I grabbed her cheeks, raised her hips a little, and then slammed them against my thighs, making Blake&#39;s eyes widen as she screamed, dropping down on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s how you move,&#34; I mumbled, inhaling her warm breath as she panted heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling, she clutched onto my neck, her body softening into mine as I whispered into her ear, &#34;We just started, and you are already at your peak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#34; Blake whispered, her nail deep in my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting from the pillow, I inserted her properly on my lap, kissing her neck as she flinched, and then nibbled the exact spot I bit her the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise that left her lips was pleasant to my ears, and the way her hands hugged onto my body as I thrust made me wild with stamina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Nero&#34; Blake cried, the rest of her words lost with the sound of her moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her cheek, I hugged her waist tightly as my fang sunk deeper into her skin, holding her tightly as she jerked in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more,&#34; I whispered, looking into her moist eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third mark seals the deal. There&#39;s no backing out of this. Once I bite Blake, I&#39;m her alpha until I reject her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem uncomfortable. Let&#39;s swap positions.&#34; I said softly, claiming her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers caressed into Blake&#39;s hair grabbed handfuls of it and crushed her mouth to mine as her firm hand slid into my hair, and her nails hugged my back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting her against the mattress, I rested between her legs and looked into her eyes as I said, &#34;I&#39;m going to try not to hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she gave me a weak smile, I pressed her hands against the bed and mumbled, &#34;Be patient with me a little. It will soon be over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Blake whispered when I brought my lips towards her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers squeezed mine tightly as I licked the blood off her skin. Then I bit into her flesh, grabbing her leg as they spread up, and she let out another scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you tired,&#34; I mumbled, looking into her drowsy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting down on her lip, Blake clutched onto my neck and whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t take it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck, she was driving me insane! And although she bears all three of my marks, I still didn&#39;t feel it yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the marking process, our bond is supposed to grow stronger in which now we can not only feel each other&#39;s emotions but also read each other&#39;s thoughts, and yet nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Blake was my responsibility from the very beginning. Since she was a baby, I was given that commitment by her mother, and with or without the bond, I&#39;m going to protect her until it&#39;s safe to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something this stupid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>******Blake POV******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling his hand resting against my bare skin, I tried not to move or make a sound even though I have been awake for a couple of minutes now and judging by the brightness in the room, it was late in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nero had finally let me rest, and he was sound asleep which was not fair because I was drained and restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the heck am I doing? Everyone knows Nero to be Luna&#39;s mate, and yet, I have pressured him into claiming me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I hate Luna, she still thinks of him as her mate. What if we both were mated to the same alpha, and I just stole him from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Nero doesn&#39;t know who his mate is because of a curse. But Luna wouldn&#39;t claim him out of the blue if he wasn&#39;t her mate, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stupid! That&#39;s how I felt. So much was at stake now because of this mess I have created with Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would have been fine if he would have claimed me before he announced to everyone that Luna was his mate, and now, I feel shitty really frustrated with myself for allowing my heart to rule over my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I raised my eyelids and pushed Nero&#39;s hand off my stomach, throwing him a hard look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he raised his gaze and stared at me, his eyes drowsy as he mumbled, &#34;What&#39;s with that look?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What look?&#34; I muttered, leaving the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Blake. Don&#39;t play dumb with me. You have that look that says you are up to no good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I guess you are terrible at reading people&#39;s facial expressions because I am up to good today all things positive. No, negative energy here! At least not from my end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he raised his brow, I smiled brightly. But he frowned and said, &#34;Now, you are just trying to pull my leg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not, Nero. I&#39;m truly fine.&#34; I mumbled, keeping my smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lies all lies. I wasn&#39;t okay to say the very least. The feeling of guilt was eating me alive. How I could do something this stupid? I barely have anyone in the pack who likes me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scratch that! No one in the pack likes me, and I went and did something this shitty! I can only imagine the names that I am going to get called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!... Hello, is anyone home upstairs!&#34; Nero called out, snapping his fingers, and I dragged myself out of my head. &#34;Do you want to tell me what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hoe! The bitch who stole her sister&#39;s mate! A slut!... A gold digger! What have you done, Blake!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes felt frozen as they stretched wide open as I absentmindedly looked at Nero leaving the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when he reached me, I finally allowed my lashes to blink when he said, &#34;You know that honesty is a beautiful thing, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing into his eyes, I smile, wondering why there is this mental wall blocking me from accessing his feelings and mind although he was now my alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and acceptance is also a fascinating thing. So maybe you should accept that I am fine and stop asking questions.&#34; I whispered, resting my palms against his chest when he grabbed me by my waist and pulled me against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Nero gave me an intense stare. Then he patted my head and mumbled, &#34;Okay, I believe you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop making me feel short,&#34; I muttered, pushing his hand off me. &#34;What&#39;s the time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Nero said, looking a bit confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go. I want to get my phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I feel like yesterday was a terrible mistake. I want you, Nero, but how am I supposed to feel okay when Luna is in the picture, and I am on the wrong side of all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got to get to class,&#34; I mumbled, avoiding his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing me against his body as his grip on my waist became firm, Nero nibbled on my neck, exciting my body, and then whispered, &#34;I see someone is already really for the sixth round.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero,&#34; I mumbled, losing the rest of my words by his kiss as his hand lowered down my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his phone buzzed, and it was a save by the bell moment because even though my body was already reacting to his touch, I had other plans for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking away from me and picking up his phone, he looked back at me, and I could see a look of hesitation in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Luna,&#34; Nero announced, looking directly into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead, and answer,&#34; I mumbled with a soft smile although I was screaming inside. &#34;I should take a shower. My body feels sticky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for Nero to say a word, I walked out of the room and headed into the bathroom, holding my tears in my eyelids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; Nero&#39;s voice echoed from the other side of the door as I rested my back against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, babe. Do you want me to drop by the campus or you know, you can just give me your address, and I can come to visit you.&#34; I heard Luna say, and although I was only hurting myself by eavesdropping, I couldn&#39;t help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A drop by at the campus is just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, we have only a few days until we are official. My mother is excited, and my dad is okay with adopting you into the pack after the full moon, so don&#39;t you think it&#39;s weird that we have met everywhere but your house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t I come over to your place?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you on campus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call without answering her question. But the answer was simple. I was the reason, and I felt weird, knowing that, like I was his perfect secret. And now that he is okay with us not being a secret anymore, isn&#39;t the damage already done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Nero called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicking, I locked the bathroom door, not sure what I was doing. But I didn&#39;t want him seeing me like this in tears and pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of his footsteps echoed for a while, and then the knob aggressively jiggled a couple of times before Nero said out loud, &#34;I am going to break things off with Luna today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t.&#34; I calmly uttered, struggling to keep myself from breaking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you just give me a little time to get ready to tell everyone about us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Nero. We both know the gravity of such news. I need a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed after my remark left me nervous and even more miserable. But after a few more minutes of silence, Nero finally said, &#34;Sure. Take your time, and tell me when you are ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scary part of his words. I don&#39;t think I will ever be ready, and I know it is stupid that I am afraid of being ridiculed by people who have treated me terribly, but my fear, guilt, and insecurity wouldn&#39;t go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Nero wasn&#39;t cursed and knew exactly what he wanted, I could have the confidence that I am the one for him. But there are two of us, and I don&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire life, I have been second to my sister in everything my father&#39;s affection, the pack respect, and all other things... And when it comes to Nero, I am scared that he is going to wake up one morning and realize that he made a mistake by choosing me over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to open the door, Blake?&#34; Nero said, sounding annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I whispered, watching my voice so he can&#39;t tell that I&#39;m silently crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to use the bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wear your clothes and go back to your room. There&#39;s a bathroom there if I can remember correctly! Use it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another silence fell between us, then I heard him sigh before saying, &#34;Okay. What will you be having for breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything will be fine,&#34; I mumbled, glad that he wasn&#39;t pushing the topic any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Nero finally left the room, I had a hot shower, and honestly, it made me feel a bit better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I had gotten dressed, I was about to style my hair when my phone vibrated on the nightstand, and I walked over to see who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my deepest fear, it was Loki, and his text read, &#34;Don&#39;t forget that Gustav is picking you up after your classes are over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting down on my nail, I read his text over and over, trying to make up my mind. Then I finally wrote back, &#34;What if I refuse Killian, but get marked by another really powerful alpha, will our deals still stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a while for Loki to reply, and every quiet second felt like torture until another text arrive, &#34;What are you talking about now, Blake? Which other powerful Alpha do you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, do you plan to stay in your room all day?&#34; Nero&#39;s voice flowed into my ear, and my heart immediately skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Forget that I said a thing.&#34; I messaged Loki.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t start to act up now and come home, okay? You and Killain have a date two days before the full moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s two days from now. What am I going to do? Nero isn&#39;t seriously going to kill Killian if I forget about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake?&#34; Nero called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming!&#34; I shouted back, shoving my phone in my jeans pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, I&#39;m just going to take things one step at a time and try to do what is best, no matter if it hurts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hates us being together</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*******Nero POV*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single word Blake said to me as she sat at the counter, staring intensely at me with an absent look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The toaster went off with a little click, and I tried to get the two slices of bread out of it when I felt hands hug onto my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you making?&#34; Blake whispered, her head resting on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toast with cheese,&#34; I mumbled, laying the bread on the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip on me got tighter, and I knew something was off about the way she was acting this morning, but she refused to open up about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I gave my curiosity a little push and mumbled, &#34;Want to talk about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About the toast and cheese?&#34; Blake asked with a faint chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this is the game you want us to play, then that&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands loosened from around my waist, and I turned to meet her eyes, thinking she was emotional. But instead, I was met with a smile as she asked, &#34;Can you give me the Jeep key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said that you didn&#39;t want it,&#34; I mumbled, confused about how she keeps switching in-between emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pouting, a naive look settled in Blake&#39;s eyes as she mumbled, &#34;Since we are not going to be a secret anymore a couple of days from now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, a couple of days? You must be kidding me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not. Also, that&#39;s why it&#39;s not an issue driving Jeep to school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I knew that there was more going on in that tiny head of hers, I gave a faint chuckle and mumbled, &#34;The key is in my room, on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, tipping toes to meet my height, Blake kissed me on the cheek and then whispered, &#34;Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she was about to walk away, I grabbed her wrist, pulled her back into my arm, and looked solely into her darting eyes as I said, &#34;What was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A kiss,&#34; Blake whispered, pouting slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although her tone made her sound like she was annoyed and her eyes gave it away that she was sheepish, the sound of her pounding heartbeat told me she craved a taste of me as much as I wanted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a room you two,&#34; Jason&#39;s dull voice suddenly echoed from the doorway, and my gaze danced over Blake&#39;s head, throwing him a hard look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason!&#34; Blake shouted nervously as she struggled to break free from my grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t release her, she looked back at me with a scowl on her face and mumbled, &#34;Nero, let go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You didn&#39;t have a problem kissing him in front of me and everyone else. So what are you nervous about?&#34; I mumbled, not taking my gaze off Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on don&#39;t act like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A jerk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging my gaze away from Jason, I looked into Blake&#39;s eyes, ignoring the frown on her, and pressed her against me, leaning towards her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips were soft against mine, and I felt the weak tickle of her breath beneath my nose as I kissed her, tasting the coffee she had a couple of minutes ago on her tongue as it tangled with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When our lips parted, my grip on her waist weakened, and Blake pulled away from my arm with her face in a tight pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying her gaze off me, she looked at Jason, tilting her shoulders, and she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then as Blake was about to walk past him, she stopped and mumbled, &#34;I will be taking myself to school today and back, so there&#39;s no need to escort me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked out of the room, leaving the two of us alone, and we didn&#39;t say a word to each other, even after Jason took a seat on the stool at the counter until Blake came back into the kitchen with the car key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still looking pissed, she walked over to me, and as I was about to take another bite into my toast with cheese, she gently took the bread out of my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yours is right there,&#34; I said, gazing at the mischievous look she gave me before biting into my food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring my words, she took the other toast off the plate and quietly walked away, leaving me speechlessly staring behind her, wondering how petty she could get over a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Blake was about to walk out the doorway, a sense of uneasiness ceased my heart, and I said, &#34;I&#39;m trusting you not to do anything stupid today. Don&#39;t prove me wrong, or else&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will punish me?&#34; Blake said with a sarcastic tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she glared back at me with my bread stuck between her lips, I looked her dead in the eyes and said, &#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smirk on Blake&#39;s face faded as her expression turned serious, and her eyes remained glued on me for a moment before she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while went by, and once the sound of the Jeep had faded out of the yard, Jason looked at me, mumbling, &#34;So you two are now official?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his question, I grabbed my phone off the counter, shoved it into my coat pocket, and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jason suddenly blocked my way, causing me to stop in my steps as he coldly uttered, &#34;Don&#39;t break her heart, Nero. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Blake was going to not get her heart shattered by me even if I try to be careful with it. The cracks I have made are already there, although she doesn&#39;t know yet, and it just takes the final blow to completely break her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to get to class,&#34; I told him, my eyes on his. &#34;Also, I know you think you know me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think I ever did. You are so fucking close up about everything about your life, Nero!&#34; Jason harshly said, his eyes yellow with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his anger and the fact that he looked like he wanted to punch me hard in the face, I calmly uttered, &#34;Don&#39;t be a Judas with me to my Father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Jason mumbled, his anger switched with a look of confusion on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell my father about Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Jason didn&#39;t give me an answer, I walked past him and headed out of the kitchen, knowing that his loyalty towards me is greater than his feelings for Blake and his respect for my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally entered the classroom at eight fifty, Blake was already seated in the back row of the class, and I felt a sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was already crowded with all my students, except Karen which was simply perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of her absence, my lecture went smoothly, and it was the most successful lesson I have taught since I entered this school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, my time was up, and when Blake stood up from her seat, my eyes followed her fingers as she pushed her hair out of her face, her lashes as they rested gently against her skin, and her lips as they slightly twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe!&#34; I suddenly heard Luna&#39;s voice echo in my ear, and I immediately turned to see her standing right beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, she rushed into my arm, grabbed me by my neck, and pulled me towards her mouth, claiming my lip and nipping on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled back quickly which caused her to accidentally cut my lip open, and I saw a look of horror on her face as she rubbed her thumb against my skin and cried out, &#34;I&#39;m so sorry Does it hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my attention was disturbed off her as Blake walked past us, not even looking our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, wait!&#34; I called out, and she stopped, refusing to look back at me for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she finally turned around with a calm look in her eyes and said, &#34;Yes, professor Fang. Do you need something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she playing at, telling me not to cut things off with Luna and continuing to pretend as though we were strangers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My patience didn&#39;t want me to give in to her desire, but she was right. This was not a simple situation we were involved in, and I can&#39;t just put her on the spot, so I&#39;m going to give in to her wish for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. I forget what I wanted to say.&#34; I mumbled, unable to bury my burning desire to walk over to her and take her by the waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Blake let out in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she turned to leave, Luna frowned and said, &#34;Are we not on speaking terms, sister?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not play pretend today, Luna. I don&#39;t have the energy to put up an act.&#34; Blake mumbled before walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, my patience has run out. It was clear that She hates us being together, and I don&#39;t care what her true reason is for wanting us to wait, but tomorrow, I&#39;m making it known to everyone that she&#39;s mine with or without her approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let go</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*******Blake POV******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in my last class felt like torture because I knew my time was up to make a decision. Although I have already made up my mind, the thought of giving Nero up for good was messing with my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How do you walk away from someone that has your heart? It was the most painful shit I have ever experienced because the wound was internal, and not even my healing power could fix it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Class dismiss!&#34; Mrs. Xana said, closing her book, and I rested my head on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only I could make this moment freeze, so I wouldn&#39;t have to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; I suddenly heard a deep voice call out my name, and my body stiffened as I shut my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he called my name again, I held in my breath, feeling like the air was being squeezed from my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got quiet for a while. Then I felt a gentle tap on my back, and I raised my head to see Gustav, standing over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving me a gentle smile, he said, &#34;Blake, your father asked me to take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I mumbled, feeling drained to wake from my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew it was time to walk away from Nero, even though all I wanted to do was stay. So I forced myself out of my seat and picked up my book bag, returning Gustav a smile before walking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After we arrived in the parking lot, I gazed at my Jeep, feeling awful that I was abandoning it on campus, even though it was only a distraction so Jason can not escort me this morning to school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking one last look at it, I sighed before getting into the Mercedes-Benz back seat, and Gustav slammed the door shut behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is so freaking painful, but it&#39;s not going to hurt forever, right? A couple of months without Nero, and I will be fine. Time is all I need a long distance between is what I need to forget him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gustav started to drive the car out of the campus, I pulled out my phone and gazed at my GPS map.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting kidnapped by those psychos and having to get lectured by Nero for it was terrifying, and I think it has given me some kind of PTSD because I trust no driver other than him and Jason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, the car had tinted windows which only increased my PTSD to a great extent, and I wasn&#39;t even blinking normally as I intensely stared at my phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a couple of minutes, we were driving in the right direction. Then I noticed that Gustav made a left turn which did not make sense because it was in the opposite direction from the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gustav, you have been driving for Loki and Loretta for a couple of years. Who would you say has earned your loyalty?&#34; I mumbled, feeling my wolf becoming alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of question is that, Blake?&#34; Gustav asked, his voice calm, yet his tone gave it away that he was nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it. I already have my answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, If I keep going with you, I might never reach the mansion, so stop the car!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand what you are talking about, Blake.&#34; Gustav chuckled without stopping or slowing down his speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop the damn car, Gustav!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling an intense force in the atmosphere, my transformation started from my fingers, and once my claws were out, I waited impatiently for an opportunity to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he suddenly accelerated the car&#39;s speed, I knew it was now or never, so I rushed from my seat, and when I jumped into the front seat, I realized Gustav had a blade, not just any knife, but one forge from pure silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping one hand on the steering wheel, he vigorously aimed for my chest with the blade. But my claws were already stuck deep into his hand, penetrating his bone before the blade could reach me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got messy pretty fast with him bleeding on my favorite jeans. But the smell of his blood only enraged my wolf, and I twirled my claws hard in his skin, causing a scream of agony to escape his lips and the knife to drop on my lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you notice?!&#34; Gustav cried out, his moist yellow eyes fix on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t have suspected if you had just taken me home.&#34; I calmly uttered, picking up the knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My focus shifted for a second onto the V mirror, and I stared at my red eyes before hitting the knife into his chest, pushing it deep into his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately the was a loud, &#34;Bang!&#34; and a sharp pain ran through my skull when my head slammed into the dashboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alarm when off, and the noise was earsplitting as I raised my head and pushed the door open, getting down from the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I had balanced myself on both my feet and the pain in my head had subsided, I realized the car had whacked into a tree. Thankfully, it only had a few scratches and wasn&#39;t damaged badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, we were in the middle of the Dusty freeway which was literally deserted, and I guess he chose this lane because we&#39;ll, he wanted to kill me and dumped my body in secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know that I should just turn around and go back to Nero, but things just got personal between Loretta and me, and if she wants me dead this bad, then I don&#39;t mind taking everything from her and her daughter, putting both of them in their rightful place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fill with rage, I walked over to the driver&#39;s door, pushed Gustav&#39;s body onto the passager seat, and got behind the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart kept pumping wildly as I drove at full speed, and even after I arrived home, I was still shaking with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I brought the car to a stop, I raced into the house, and unfortunately, I met Loretta, coming from the opposite direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of horror shadowed her face as she blurted out, &#34;Blake?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Loki!?&#34; I shouted, struggling against my wolf&#39;s eagerness to take control of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to walk past her, she suddenly blocked my way and asked, &#34;Why are you covered in blood!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should know!&#34; I lashed out, slowly losing grip of my anger. &#34;Loki! Get down here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, blocking my way as I tried to move past her, a fake-ass look of concern settled on Loretta&#39;s face as she mumbled, &#34;Are you hurt?! What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Loretta! I&#39;m not hurt. Gustav is dead, that&#39;s what happened!&#34; I shouted, losing my patience completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t play dumb with me, Loretta!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drop the act and get out of my damn face! I didn&#39;t come here for you! Got it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger sparked in Loretta&#39;s eyes, and before I could react, she raised her hand and smacked me in the cheek, cutting my lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without holding back, I lost grip of my anger and slapped her with force, returning the favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bitch!&#34; Loretta screamed, her palm hugging her bruised cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; Loki yelled, looking at us from up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen a bitch lose it! Lay your hands on me again, and you will find out! That&#39;s a promise!&#34; I told Loretta before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached Loki, he scowled at me and mumbled, &#34;Why are you covered in blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gustav tried to make me a past tense, so I killed him in self-defense,&#34; I said, looking down at my bloody jeans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would Gustav try to kill you?! He has been working for this family for years, and he never laid a hand on you or attempted to hurt you!&#34; Loretta shouted when Loki glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at her bitter expression, I met her eyes and casually uttered, &#34;Why would I kill Gustav then? I have been living in this mansion for years, and I never tried to kill him before!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two stop your nonsense argument!&#34; Loki yelled, scowling at me. &#34;Blake, go to your room and get rid of that bloody clothes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, I walked back downstairs, marched past Loretta, not caring for the dirty look she gave me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five steps ahead, I stopped in my tracks, looked up at Loki, and said, &#34;Gustav is in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, you can&#39;t seriously let her get away with murder, especially when he&#39;s a member of this pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was going to die, Loretta. Even if Blake wouldn&#39;t have been successful in killing him, I would have done the job. My daughter&#39;s life is off-limits to any and everyone in this pack! You should know that!&#34; Loki said, his tone numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Loretta glared back at me, I dragged my gaze off her and walked away, heading to the basement where my room was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived inside, squeaky noises echoed from the floor as I approached my dresser, and finally, the sound stopped when I stood still, gazing at my image in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wound on my lips had already healed. But the one in my heart was still very fresh, and I blinked back my tears, sniffing softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my back pocket and when I took it out, I wasn&#39;t surprised to see a text from Nero, &#34;I told you not do something stupid! Why don&#39;t you like to listen, Blake?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even ask me where I was or why I haven&#39;t gone home yet and just assumed that I had done something stupid. Is that how little he thinks of me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught in the middle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*******Nero POV******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity of Blake is getting on my nerve. If I didn&#39;t have people in the Hayes&#39; mansion, I would still be in the dark about the death of Loki&#39;s driver, her going back home with bloody jeans, and getting slapped by Loretta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Luna&#39;s voice forced me to stare away from my screen and focused on her, intensely staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I mumbled, still disturbed that Blake had not replied to my text yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t touched your food since your phone buzzed a while back, and that&#39;s all you have been paying attention to, even though I am sitting right in front of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what you are right. I am distracted, and I&#39;m not in the mood for food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A confused look settled in Luna&#39;s eyes, then she gave a half-smile, lowering her eyelids as she mumbled, &#34;Then what are you in the mood for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;To teach your sister a lesson, but that is not for your ears to hear.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing my patience, I stood from my seat and said, &#34;Let&#39;s go. I will take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34; Luna mumbled as I walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dropping my credit card at the counter and paying our bills, I walked back to her, and we left the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire time I was driving her home, I was telling myself to calm down and not do something stupid. But the closer we got to the mansion, I knew there was no telling what I was going to do because my anger was getting its way with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant I brought the car to a stop, I unbuckled my seatbelt, and as I was about to head out of the car, Luna&#39;s voice stopped me, &#34;You are going inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I mumbled, pushing the car door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire brain was messed up as I headed for the door with Luna following me, and when we reached inside, my ears were alert for the sound of Blake&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero!&#34; Loretta announced happily when we arrived in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My attention was totally off her when I said, &#34;Hello, Loretta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So far, there was no sign of Blake. If I should guess, she had her scent masked, and Loki had most of the room in this damn place soundproof which is why my spies don&#39;t have the useful information that I need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake!&#34; I heard Luna say, and immediately, I turned around to meet Blake&#39;s calm eyes with Loki by her side at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero, I didn&#39;t know that we were having a visit from you today,&#34; Loki said as he walked into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Why do you always have to put me in deep shit?! What more do you want me to do?! Do you have to always pinpoint me against the wall?!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words remained only thoughts as I stared deep into Blake&#39;s numb gaze, and I wondered what was going on in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squeezing my fists, I kept my eyes fixed on hers and marched over to the doorway, torn between the dilemma that I was making a terrible mistake and that I needed to get her out of there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was only a step away from her, the buzz from my phone caused me to pause, and I could see the look of relief on Blake&#39;s face as I pulled my phone out of my pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was my father, and his message left me paralyzed, &#34;Come home. I am waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. Why would he choose now to visit! Maybe I should have not ignored his texts and his calls for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoving my phone back into my pocket, I turned around to gaze at Luna, Loki, and Loretta, and said, &#34;I need to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay?&#34; Luna asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vladimir Fang, visiting me, of course, everything is not okay. But I faintly nodded and said, &#34;Sure, just need to check up on something quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake&#39;s situation will just have to wait until I find out what my father wants. So I turned around, looked Blake in the eyes, and walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got home, I stopped as I was about to walk past the dining room and gazed at my father and Jason seated at the table, while he ate calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Jason and I locked eyes, I clenched my jaw, assuming that he was the one who called my father. But the look of anxiety in his eyes told me this was not his doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father!&#34; I said in a cheerful tone, trying to soften any tension in the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why haven&#39;t you been answering my calls, Nero.&#34; My father asked, raising his gaze off his chicken and focusing on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyeing Jason, I felt reluctant to speak, knowing that I didn&#39;t want him here for this discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is Jason here?&#34; I mumbled, dodging the question because I haven&#39;t found a lie to give him as an excuse yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He answers his phone unlike someone else in this room, and that&#39;s why I was able to enter your house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Jason didn&#39;t snitch to my father about Blake and me, and I felt a bit relieved, but just for a second before my father said, &#34;Jason, can you excuse us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even hesitating for a second, Jason stood from his seat, walked out of the room, and headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his vehicle sound had faded out of the yard, my father rested back in his seat and said, &#34;What is going on, Nero! I sent you to come here to get the names of everyone who was involved in the massacre of most of our pack members and your mother&#39;s death, but up to now, you are still here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, he leaned forward towards the table, resting his elbows on it as he asked, &#34;What&#39;s the holdup, son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loki proved to be a very awake guy. I haven&#39;t earned his trust yet, and he wouldn&#39;t let information like that slip out to just anyone. I need time.&#34; I said, keeping a straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, &#39;we wiped them out with or without the list!&#39; And you said that you don&#39;t want to make the exact mistake of the past, so we should do it properly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, and I still feel that way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With anger flashing in his eyes, my father&#39;s fingertips slowly hit the desk. Then he stopped and said emotionlessly, &#34;Okay. But my patience is running out! Every time I fall asleep without your mother by myself, knowing that ass is alive, I want to kill him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I will kill him and the rest of them! But my way, and on my own terms and time and not how we handled it back then!&#34; I let out, keeping my voice firm so that he knows that I wasn&#39;t kidding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, my father&#39;s fingers slowly clutched into a fist as he coldly uttered, &#34;Loki wouldn&#39;t be alive if you didn&#39;t chicken out, allowing that dog and his pack to go in hidden for all those years and making it difficult for us to find him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was the words that had me searching for Loki for years until I recently found him and his pack in this state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know! It&#39;s all I have heard you talk about for years!&#34; I shouted, losing grip on my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you let your mother down!&#34; My father yelled, his veins bulging in his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, father! Your guilt game is the only reason I&#39;m in this damn place, putting my entire life on pause!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My guilt game! You should be angry furious! That bastard killed your mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling rage burn hot from within, I went numb and mumbled, &#34;When I was like three!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might have been too young to grief, but I mourn your mother for years, even till this day!&#34; My father shouted, hitting his hand on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why after you lost her, you forget that you had a son to raise. Instead, you became a leader, but not my father, putting your burden of vengeance upon my shoulders because of the power of my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want Loki dead, along with everyone who was a part of that massacre!&#34; My father said in a calmer tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will,&#34; I let out, suppressing my rage. &#34;But when the time is right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of silent seconds, my father stood from his seat, removing his coat from the chair as he grumbled, &#34;I have a flight to catch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not replying, I watched him walk away from the table, walked past me, and left the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice to see you too, father.&#34; I mumbled, darting my gaze around the room, trying to figure out what my next move is going to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>love and vengeance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*******Jason Pov*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody told me the act of selflessness was going to feel like a blow to the chest and steal your sleep away from you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight just feels annoying now because I am stuck to my bed, not wanting to get up. But Vladimir Fang visited Nero. That can not be a good thing judging from their expression last night. Now I feel the need to check on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! How do you care for someone, and yet, want to punch them so bad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave myself a couple of seconds to get out of my feelings and then forced myself out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I got done showering and had worn something comfortable, I headed out of my suite, wondering if Blake was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried calling her yesterday when Vladimir informed me that he was in the state so she could get out of the house, but she didn&#39;t answer. I had to send her a text, and I was glad that she wasn&#39;t home when we got there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walked into the hotel lobby, I halted, gazing at Harley leaving with a guy, and her body language was giving me an awkward vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring after them, I noticed that she didn&#39;t seem like herself, so I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets and walked after them, keeping my distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know it&#39;s not my place to meddle in other people&#39;s affairs. But the vibe I was getting from the two of them was off, so I followed just to make sure that she was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the hotel parking lot, the guy Harley was with unlocked the car door for her, but she refused as she said, &#34;I got work to do, Leo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I not leaving with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you are my property. If I say get into the car, you get your ass into the car!&#34; This Leo dude shouted in her face, and I knew to mind my business, but I didn&#39;t like his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can not walk in and out of my life whenever you please, Leo! And didn&#39;t you claim Cila, so why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both of us argue. I don&#39;t want to touch her as a punishment. That&#39;s where you come into the picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You only need me because&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because the only one I can think of having sex with other than Cila is you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is a big difference between minding your business and protecting someone from a jerk, and I think my self-control just slipped out of my restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still standing? Get into the damn car!&#34; Leo let out aggressively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Leo. I am not playing this game with you again! You made your choice! You gave me my freedom after claiming Cila, so you don&#39;t own me, not anymore,&#34; Harley said boldly, but I could hear the fear in her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you are not going to do as I say!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have always been a stubborn bitch! Don&#39;t blame me for being violent then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, I am done with restraining myself, especially since Leo had grabbed Harley by the arm and was pushing her into the front seat of his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harley!&#34; I shouted, walking over to them. &#34;What is going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached them, Leo scowled at me as he let go of her arm, faced me, and said, &#34;You are the creep who likes following and listening in on people&#39;s conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you are the ass who thinks forcing someone to do something and talking shit to her is cool!&#34; I told him, allowing my wolf to awaken as I gaze into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking dumbfoundedly at me, he sneered, and then looked at Harley and said, &#34;Do you know this joke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t reply, I gazed at her and calmly uttered, &#34;Harley, head back. I have a few things that I need to tell this dickhead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf was suddenly becoming so aggressive that I snarled at Leo when our eyes locked, and he slightly drew back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Harley was about to walk away, he suddenly blurted out rudely, &#34;I don&#39;t have the time for useless conversation. I&#39;m leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even say a word, he walked off, got into his car, and drove away, speeding off like some drunk driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to,&#34; Harley whispered, her voice drawing my attention back to her. &#34;Leo is not the type you want to get involved with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But I wanted to.&#34; I told her. &#34;You should go back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile on her lips, her eyes lit as she mumbled, &#34;Thank you for you know helping me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving her a brief nod, I turned to leave, but I stopped, feeling my jacket in her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I can buy you lunch or dinner any one of them that is preferable to you breakfast too to say thank you.&#34; Harley whispered, letting go of my jacket arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer in my head was, &#39;No.&#39; But when I turned around to see the warmth in her eyes, I replied, &#34;Sure. But not today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Any anytime will be fine, except my working hours, haha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was walking away, she shouted after me. &#34;Okay it&#39;s a date&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard her mumble beneath her breath, &#34;How about you stop talking, Harley!&#34; and a silent chuckle escaped my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to Nero&#39;s place, the house felt like a ghost town, and since he not Blake wasn&#39;t downstairs, I headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to Nero&#39;s room door and opened it, he was in bed, staring at me as I walked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up with you?&#34; I mumbled, sitting on the couch. &#34;And where is Blake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My questions were followed by a couple of silent minutes. Then Nero sat up, looked at me, and said, &#34;She went back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you still in bed! Grab your keys and let&#39;s go get her.&#34; I lashed out, feeling a sudden sense of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t or you won&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his silence, he gave me a cold stare, and then sighed, looking away from me as he said, &#34;I can&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna is an easier choice. I should have never strayed off the path from the very beginning and got mixed up with Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be kidding me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Jason, and I shouldn&#39;t have dragged you in this shit either!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching my fist, I felt like that punch I have been holding myself back from giving him was necessary to do now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I restrained myself and mumbled, &#34;I know you want revenge on Loki, Nero. But ask yourself if love or vengeance, which one outweighs the other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vengeance!&#34; Nero blurted out without thinking for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect</p>
                
                
                
                <p>********Blake POV*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sucks to be right, but I was. It&#39;s been only two days since I left Nero&#39;s house, and he has gone completely silent on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right, I know this is what I want, and I was the one who left him. But a part of me was hoping that he I don&#39;t knowwill maybe ask me to go back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he is still seeing Luna, and I feel, so freaking numb because I don&#39;t know how to process any of my emotions. I am afraid to feel a thing because then I will have to listen to my heart which is telling me to go back to Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Loki didn&#39;t bug me when I told him I wasn&#39;t going to school until after the full moon. I don&#39;t think I would have the strength to see Nero every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you like the dish, daughter?&#34; Loki got my attention with his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, he has been calling me that a lot, and although I feel sickened by those words every time he calls me that, it pisses Loretta and her daughter up, so I allowed him to call me that without rebelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After abandoning my thoughts, I moved my lips to speak when Loki suddenly shouted, &#34;Jessica! How dare you serve my daughter something she hates! Get rid of these dishes before I!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine! I like them!&#34; I blurted out hastily when I saw that his eyes had turned red. &#34;Honestly, it&#39;s fine, da dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn, that felt weird to say it has always been awkward to call him as such, and saying it now left me bitter, knowing that he didn&#39;t deserve to hear that word from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I need to butter Loki up a little since I didn&#39;t have Nero&#39;s backing, and he was the only one who care about protecting me right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad?&#34; Loretta mumbled with a sneer. &#34;Can you try to be less shameless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to be ashamed of, Loretta? He&#39;s my father.&#34; I mumbled, meeting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment she stared at me, then she gave Loki a side look, and her gaze suddenly dropped down to her food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long are you going to be staying here for?&#34; Luna blurted out. &#34;Is Jason okay with you leaving him and being here?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake and Jason are not together anymore,&#34; Loki uttered in a harsh tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room immediately fell silent for a couple of seconds as he glared at Luna. Then he looked at me and smiled softly as he asked, &#34;Am I right, daughter? You made it clear to him that it was over, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ye yes. It ove over between us.&#34; I mumbled, focusing on my food because my eyes were threatening to leak tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?!&#34; Luna sharply uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying his attention off me, Loki gazed at her and calmly said, &#34;Your sister has a date with Killain today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, good for you.&#34; Luna casually said, chewing a bacon as she smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, her eyes told a different story because she had a faint look of bitterness in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can not be any more proud to be a father. Two days from now, I will get two alpha as my son-in-law.&#34; Loki announced, his expression glowing with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wait for Nero to mark me so I can move out of this place and be with him&#34; Luna mumbled beneath her breath. &#34;It&#39;s becoming too crowded here for my comfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The numbness I felt faded for a second when a suffocating sensation swept through me as I stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is moving from this house.&#34; Loki blurted out, looking dead serious when I cast my gaze on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!?&#34; Luna lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I am to trust the alphas that are going to help one of you run the pack when you become the pack leader, I need to be sure that I can trust them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero and Killain will have to move in with us until I can fully trust them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This can&#39;t be happening. I am going to lose my damn mind if I live under the same roof as Nero in such a situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is crazy!&#34; Luna lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree with her.&#34; Words I never thought I would say had left my lips, and I didn&#39;t regret uttering them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not up for discussion! Before any marking can take place with you two during the full moon, those two have to agree to my conditions!&#34; Loki said, his words carrying the weight of firmness in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furrowing her brows as Luna threw me a dirty look, she sharply intoned, &#34;Dad, you don&#39;t understand! I don&#39;t want Nero living under the same roof as her?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that supposed to mean?&#34; Loki asked, and I could tell he was just as annoyed with her remark as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I don&#39;t trust her around him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop creating unnecessary drama here, Luna. Blake is not interested in Nero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting my eyes, Loretta clenched her jaws and then focused on Loki as she said, &#34;It&#39;s better safe than sorry. You don&#39;t know what your daughter is capable of. Take the incident that happened days ago for example.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would we need to worry about Blake and Nero staying under the same roof?! You and your daughter are not making any sense!&#34; Loki shouted, hitting his glass of water on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he swung his gaze on me and let out, &#34;Are you interested in Nero or have any sort of feelings for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isn&#39;t it cruel to get such a question thrown in your face when all you have been doing for the past few days is avoid asking yourself the same question?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of stupid question is that,&#34; I scoffed. &#34;Of course not. Mr. Fang is only a teacher to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing his gaze back on Loretta and Luna, Loki shouted, &#34;There you have it! Blake is not interested in Nero. I don&#39;t know why you would make such a stupid assumption!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he stood from his seat and announced, &#34;I have lost my appetite. Also, my decision has been made. So you two better start learning how to live under the same roof because I am not going to turn over the pack to anyone I don&#39;t trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought the question about who would inherit the pack was already decided a long time ago.&#34; Loretta let out as Loki was about to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, yes. But things have changed.&#34; Loki stated, his expression emotionless as he stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see how Blake going through her transformation should change Luna being the one to run the pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not the time and the place to play naive with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Loretta&#39;s eyes were downcast as she went silent when Loki said those words made me anxious to know what was going on in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, that was the least of my concerns because I had a date with Killain which was just another messy situation that I didn&#39;t want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But all I have to do is play alone with Loki&#39;s game a little longer, and I can have the information that I need about my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day didn&#39;t care that I was praying for the evening to never arrive, and just like nature doesn&#39;t give a damn, seven o&#39;clock arrived exactly when it should, and Killain was at our door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I didn&#39;t want to dress fancy, Loki took it upon himself to get me an awfully sensual dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, I hated it even more because the moment I walked downstairs into the hallway and Killain saw me in it, he had that smirk that said he was attracted to what I was wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look stunning,&#34; Killain said, his eyes on my chest rather than my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I mumbled, clutching onto my purse to calm myself down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at him, I kept telling myself that I could do this. But my wolf hated him, and I think she hates me too because I felt, even more, detach from her today and she has become silent just like before my transformation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a great time, sister,&#34; I heard Luna say, and I turned around to see her giving me a mocking smirk as she did a little wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I swayed my gaze off Luna, I caught Killain staring intensely at her without blinking, and it took him a while to realize that I was looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we?&#34; Killian calmly uttered when our eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he suddenly held me by my waist, pulled me to his side, and looked back shortly at Luna before walking away with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like shit being held by Killain like that because the only thought going on in my head was the feeling of Nero&#39;s hands against my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His touch, smell, and every slight detail about him came alive in my head as Killain led me toward his car and opened the front door for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he got behind the driver&#39;s seat, I couldn&#39;t help taking a sneak peek at my inbox, and just like the other time, Nero&#39;s last message from a few days ago was the only thing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar,&#34; I whispered, holding my tears in my eyelids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only twenty minutes into our date, and I am already being called a liar. What wrong have I done?&#34; Killain said, but I kept my focus on the windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t talking about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a relief because I really want this date to be perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling glad that his car windshield wasn&#39;t tinted, I gazed at the sky, knowing that it was the only thing that was going to be perfect about tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he&#39;s serious about marking you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*******Luna POV*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day before the full moon. I know that I should be happy that after all the acting and lies, Nero is finally going to be mine. But how can I be happy when my dear sister is in my face all of the time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now my insecurities are making me even more enraged than glad that the day is almost here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Blake had not spoken much about her date with Killian to anyone, not even my father, I knew she didn&#39;t like him, and that&#39;s kind of bittersweet for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart of me wants her to take him off my hands, and yet, I hate that it&#39;s her he&#39;s with, after all, I am still his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This none of this should be happening! My life was perfect with her just being the worthless one in the family. Why do things have to suddenly change?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage ate at me so badly that I grabbed my pillow off my bed, and I was about to toss it when my room door suddenly opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at my mother, I dropped the pillow on the blanket and composed myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she shut the door, she walked further into my room, took a seat on the couch, and finally said, &#34;It&#39;s no secret to you that things have changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, things are not the same. Dad has suddenly become super overprotective of Blake, and he would hardly let her eat food that she hates to say the very least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The death Of my uncle&#39;s six men is something that no one can talk about because dad tossed the case out the window along with the murder of his stupid driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still can&#39;t believe Blake killed him because my mother was so sure that he was going to get the job done since to be a driver for my father you have to go under secret training and stuff just in case you need to defend him during an attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mother hasn&#39;t said much about what our next move about Blake is going to be, and I am becoming restless, especially since she is living here now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We both know Nero isn&#39;t your mate. I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s willing to be with you...&#34; My mother calmly uttered, breaking the long silence, and grabbing my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me finish. I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s willing to mark you, but after he does, you should try your hardest to earn his full trust and love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting my eyes, her face hardened as she said, &#34;Now that your father is pairing Blake with Killian, we need finances to be able to manipulate others to go against the idea of supporting Blake becoming the leader of this pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still trying to process her last remark, she added, &#34;I may have the ears of some of the pack members, but money speaks louder than words, so&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need Nero&#39;s money for us to fight against Blake. I got it, and money will not be a problem.&#34; I told her with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, my mother raised a brow as she mumbled, &#34;Are you sure. I am not talking about petty cash, Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, mother! Look when Nero and I go out, he doesn&#39;t question any of our bills, no matter how crazy high they are, and he doesn&#39;t refuse to buy me anything I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stiffness in my mother&#39;s expression softened into a weak smile. Then she stroked that couch and mumbled, &#34;If that&#39;s the case, then I don&#39;t think we have anything to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing to worry about! Are you freaking kidding me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those are the words that I wanted to scream out in her face. But knowing my mother, I ended up saying, &#34;Mom, Blake got dad wrap around her finger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I have half of the pack members around mine, and you have Nero wrapped around yours.&#34; My mother said with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she scoffed and added, &#34;Plus, seeing how Killian still looks at you, I know he&#39;s only using Blake to make you jealous which means he doesn&#39;t care about her or her well-being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I wanted to argue those words, I realized that she was right. One thing about a bond between an alpha and his mate, he can get another lover, but she will always be imprinted in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that now, it actually does make me feel a bit better, knowing that Blake is just a cheap replacement for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought only gave me a brief sense of joy until I came downstairs later that morning and saw Blake seated at the dining table with dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t even allowed to sit there a few months ago, and now this is all just absurd!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was your night with Killian?&#34; My father asked almost as though he was choosing his words carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was okay,&#34; Blake whispered, poking at her meat gently, but the look in her eyes gave it away that she wanted to stab it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just okay? Come on Blake. Give me more!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What more do you want, Loki!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rise in her tone left me speechless, and from the way my mother gazed wild-eyed at her, I knew she was stunned too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying her eyes away from the meat, Blake looked at my father and said, &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to lose my cool. But tomorrow is going to be a bit stressful for me, and I just&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, Blake. I truly do. I just want to make sure that he was good to you.&#34; My father said, and my bottom lip hung loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I was blindfolded when he uttered those words, I would never believe that he was the one who spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why the heck is he so soft and careful with Blake now. I get that she has gone through her transformation. But he was never this soft with me as he is with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a matter of days, she had stolen every single fucking thing that should be mine. But after tomorrow, I am coming for her sorry ass, and I am taking back everything including the air in her lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Killian was a gentleman, and the dinner was quite romantic. He said he wanted the night to be perfect, and I didn&#39;t believe it at first, but he kept his word.&#34; Blake softly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subconsciously, I bit on my bottom lip when a dull ache hit my heart and squeezed the air out of it, leaving me feeling a bit suffocated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. I am happy that you are warming up to him.&#34; My father said, giving her a smile that disgusted me. &#34;I can&#39;t wait for tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Blake came home, it&#39;s like I don&#39;t exist to my father, and it was so frustrating to be in the room at that moment that I was about to walk away when my phone stopped me in my steps when it rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking one look at its screen, I answered immediately, feeling better when I heard Nero say, &#34;Hey, I was hoping I was hoping that you could come over to my place tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is it! It&#39;s happening! He&#39;s finally ready to open up his life to me. The excitement I felt was masked behind my calm expression as I asked, &#34;You want me over tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. You know it&#39;s the day of the full moon.&#34; Nero said, and at that moment, I caught my father staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on. Let me ask my dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a moment to breathe and composed myself, I focused on my father and said, &#34;Nero wants me over at his place tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What part of no one is moving out don&#39;t you understand, Luna?!&#34; My father lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean!&#34; I let out, struggling against the sudden anger that had ceased me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every marking process is happening under this roof!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be kidding, right?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! There will be no run tomorrow. Instead the pack will gather here to be a witness to the ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of horror suddenly crossed Blake&#39;s face as she blurted out, &#34;Are you insane, Loki?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked shaking almost as though she was about to have a panic attack, and her eyes looked moist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you freaking out? It&#39;s not like I am putting the four of you guys in the same room! It&#39;s going to be separate bedrooms, and the pack members will wait downstairs here until you guys are done.&#34; My father calmly uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh, I wish I could travel ten minutes back and make the decision to take my phone call upstairs, then I wouldn&#39;t need to hear my father explaining this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, I put Nero on hold, and it&#39;s a relief that he&#39;s not hearing any of this mess!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not doing this! I can&#39;t go through with tomorrow.&#34; Blake let out, her eyes teary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence fell in the room as we all watched her fight back tears, and it felt weird to stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father took a long look at her and asked, &#34;Are you sure, Blake? Think carefully before you answer my question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quietness in the room continued for a couple of seconds, then she sniffed and mumbled, &#34;I&#39;m just stressed. I am fine with it. Whatever you want, Loki.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying his gaze off Blake, he looked at me and said, &#34;Tell Nero that if he is serious about marking you, he will be here at sharp Eight on the dot tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worst mistake of their lives</p>
                
                
                
                <p>******Jason POV*******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loyalty is a burden that has me still visiting Nero even though every time I see him, I want to knock the shit out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know that he knows he&#39;s making a terrible mistake to let Blake go. But I guess whatever he and Vladimir Fang discussed that day, it had messed with his head so badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His father has a high influence on him, especially if it&#39;s something relating to his mother. If Vladimir says jump, even if Nero rebels, he will at last ask, &#34;How high!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The respect that I have for Vladimir is great, but I have spent my entire life with Nero. We both watch each other grow up, and that&#39;s how I know Blake is not like the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why it was so freaking easy, although painful, for me to suppress my growing desire for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that&#39;s the reason, I am standing in the hallway of Nero&#39;s villa, hoping that I can convince him to disobey his father this time around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, you are here,&#34; Nero said, walking down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I hate so much about him is that he&#39;s good at masking his feelings behind that calm, cold expression of his that makes it too damn hard to read him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems like you want to speak to me,&#34; I mumbled as he walked past me before I followed after him. &#34;I have a few words of my own to say to you myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of us headed into the living room without talking, and when Nero finally stopped in his tracks, he turned around, focused on my eyes, and said, &#34;I want you to go back home go back to the pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words abandoned my lips for a couple of seconds as I stared intensely at him, hoping he was going to burst into laughter and say, &#34;I&#39;m just kidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after the seconds seemed to turn into minutes and he didn&#39;t, I cleared my throat to awaken myself from my emotions and asked, &#34;You want me to return home, why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because!&#34; Nero let out. &#34;Because&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need honesty, or else I am not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, don&#39;t play stubborn with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning at the raise in his tone, I lashed out, feeding off my anger, &#34;We are not kids anymore, Nero. Stop trying to protect me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understandably, he will be because our family was closed before his and my birth, and after I lost it all because of Loki&#39;s attack, Vladimir took me in as part of his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older we got, Nero took the weight of leadership off my shoulder, and even though he made me his beta, he shields me like an older brother because I spent my entire childhood and teen idolizing and looking up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has always been me first, then his father second when it comes to Nero&#39;s priorities. Then he screamed at me because of Blake, and I knew right then and there, that she wasn&#39;t someone simple to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, ending the long silence that had dragged on for a while, Nero sighed and then said, &#34;Loki wants me to live under his roof after marking Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body went numb as I glared at him, wondering which part of that sentence I should address first, and at last, I answered back with an, &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going through with it, so I need you to go home. I don&#39;t want you around here when things start to get messy!&#34; Nero said with a dead-serious expression, but I wanted so desperately to believe that he was fooling around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You piece of shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t Jason me! Are you trying to commit suicide? Is that it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See! This is why I don&#39;t tell you anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a minute to get over all the pressure building up from the anger I felt and lashed out at him, &#34;I don&#39;t want you dying on me like the rest of my family. You are the only fucking thing I have left in this damn world, Nero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room instantly grew silent as he stared at me with a look of hesitation on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not going to die, Jason. This is not my first rodeo.&#34; Nero mumbled, yet those words only pissed me off more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so! Just because you return home safely to us then, that doesn&#39;t mean you will this time!&#34; I shouted. &#34;Also, how could you even think about doing something like this to Blake?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was the one who left! I was willing to risk it all for her, and she walked off without even a proper explanation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t abandon the one you claim you will risk it all for just because she walks away! We don&#39;t even know what actually made her do so!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he didn&#39;t reply, I lashed out, &#34;And to think you are planning to mark Luna! How is that even going to work if&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I plan to reject Blake tonight when&#34; The rest of his words faded when I slammed my fist into his cheek, and before I could stop myself, I had already landed a second hit in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning at me, Nero wiped his nose, gazed at the blood, and mumbled, &#34;Beating me up will not change my mind. I should have kept my priorities straight from the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sick bastard!!&#34; I shouted in his face, squeezing my fist to stop myself from striking again for the third time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of dismay shallows Nero&#39;s expression as he blurted out, &#34;Believe me, you are not the only one that I am disappointing! I am breaking a promise with someone who made me swear that I will not let any harm come to Blake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, what?!&#34; I mumbled in shock. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, Jason, I tried to make everyone pleased and fix this mess neutrally. But in the end, I can not have both. Sacrifices have to be made, and my mind is made up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am getting you a ticket, and I want you on a  flight tomorrow. It&#39;s a command!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t like his tone, not one bit, because it gave it away that he was serious his mind was fixed on sacrificing his feelings for Blake for vengeance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to get over the reality that this was it, I watched Nero walk off, and then I finally got out of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wasn&#39;t going to do something to stop this madness, then I would. It&#39;s not like he&#39;s the only one allowed to take on a suicide mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I got back to the hotel and entered my suite, the sound of a knock caused me to reopen the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; Harley mumbled, darting her eyes away from mine when I stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?!&#34; I let out before realizing how harsh my tone was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm The thing is I he-ard th-at Rumors are going around about Blake and Killian, and I I I wanted to check on you to see if you are okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am fine. You don&#39;t have to worry about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Okay. I am glad that you are then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing her eyes on mine, she gave me a soft smile and mumbled, &#34;I should get back to my desk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was about to walk away, I grabbed her wrist, and she turned to stare at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about my tone just now,&#34; I said, knowing that she didn&#39;t deserve to share in the rage that I have for Nero. &#34;It&#39;s nice that you are concerned about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. I know how devastating it feels when they are not the one, and everything in you believes that they are.&#34; Harley said as I let go of her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked off, and my gaze followed her for a couple of seconds before I shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After standing still for a while, I was about to head to my closet to find something to wear for tonight when my phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that it was Blake calling, I immediately answered the call and listened to her say, &#34;Hey,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all I am going to get after you suddenly walk out on me and Nero?&#34; I asked, not knowing if I should be mad at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry, Jason, for not picking up your calls and everything else. I knew you would try to stop me, and I don&#39;t want you to do so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you and Nero so damn stubborn!... Why are you doing this, Blake?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of my mother, Jason. Loki will only let me know about her if I do as he wants, and bearing Killian&#39;s mark is what he asks. I thought it&#39;s only fair you knew the truth, so you won&#39;t be left with concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to I have to do this, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I buried my face into my palm, drawing a breath because I was left in a dilemma, and at that moment I understood slightly what Nero must feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s say, hypothetically I come over there to get you,&#34; I mumbled, still trying to be optimistic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t. I am begging you.&#34; Blake said almost in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that how you truly feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was painful to accept, but the was nothing I could do to stop these two fools from making the worse mistakes of their life.</p>
