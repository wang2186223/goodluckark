                <p>I stop when I heard footsteps heading my way. I hide to the nearest tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean they wanted to keep that royalty?&#34; Are they talking about Clint? I lean closer to the tree, as I conceal my presence. Only those who have a higher rank like an Alpha can distinguish our presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the one they caught yesterday. He was being held in the facility. And if they didn&#39;t used sedative. We wouldn&#39;t be able to get him confined.&#34; The other one said. Facility? My eyes widens. They have another facility? It was right under our nose? How did we not find it? We&#39;ve been searching for it for years, or Clint and the others are searching for it for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking off my cape, I then decided to show myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit! She was one of th-&#34; before they could even react I already used my abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to where Clint is.&#34; They both nodded their heads, then I followed them from behind, they both started heading towards an unfamiliar part of the territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a mountain part, I glance at it, it was not that steep but what keeps it dangerous is that this place is quite similar to the Dark forest, where you could get lost if you don&#39;t know the exact way. And by the looks of them, they quite know where they where going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that long walk before we reach the building. It looks somehow similar to the one in the Island but this one is smaller than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is with-&#34; I put them all to sleep, making sure no one is awake that might disturb me. I was pissed enough and I don&#39;t wanna end up losing control on this place and right now I need to avoid getting into their radar. Because I know it might lead to putting everyone in great danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve done enough damage in the past, and I&#39;ve killed a lot of innocent people, which also resulted to this endless war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I check all the room and was surprised to found children being held in the capsules, but this children aren&#39;t human. They are actually werewolves. I remember that they used this kind of thing before to us. Letting us sleep until we start showing progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Doctors who are facilitating was already sleeping, I couldn&#39;t help but feel angry at them. They didn&#39;t stop robbing the children from their innocence. And now they are doing this again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will kill them if you&#39;ll do that.&#34; I turned around to find Rion, he was also being held up. But he was on a glass cage, the one Vicky used before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; He looks worse, his body deteriorate, his bones are actually showing now. The long known Rion was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They keep using me for their experiments but to their disappointment it wasn&#39;t working.&#34; He mumbled, then he started throwing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you let this happened to you?&#34; I felt bad for him, I know he wasn&#39;t the best Alpha of the South after hearing everything he have done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Klaire, I deserve it after everything I&#39;ve done to her.&#34; He mumbled, is this how a mate less Alpha is? Especially after their mate died in their own hands? The memory of the second war flash in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he also felt this way after what he did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should now ask you, why are you still here? Or did you perhaps go back here for him?&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything and started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it, both of you couldn&#39;t fight the bond no matter how hard you both try.&#34; I ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have time for it Rion, now I want to know what you know about this.&#34; He then glance at the direction that I was pointing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know anything, they would tell me anyway. But I did heard them saying about the fact that adult werewolves ended up dying because of the experiment, to the point that they couldn&#39;t handle the changes in their body. Like their wolf is trying to fight back.&#34; He said, I don&#39;t know if I could trust his words right now but I couldn&#39;t just dismissed any information without further knowledge about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So they used the children?&#34; He nodded his head. Exactly like what they did to us before. But this time it felt like they wanted to recreate something fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where Clint is?&#34; He looks surprised at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying that they also got Clint? I thought Dwayne was the only one who got caught.&#34; I froze after hearing his name. He then notice my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you don&#39;t know? Dwayne was with me a few weeks ago, but unlike me he was put inside those tube like.&#34; He uttered, pointing at the capsules. I didn&#39;t say anything. Dismissing his words. It was impossible that he was captured, after what I saw earlier. He was acting pretty normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clench my fist remembering what I just saw earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like I couldn&#39;t get any information from you. Do you want to perhaps get out of there?&#34; I couldn&#39;t just live him here even though he was the one who kidnapped me before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He said firmly while shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In this place I was abled to see her you know. And I wouldn&#39;t let you take that opportunity to me.&#34; I didn&#39;t say anything, by the look of it Rion was already out of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then, take care of yourself Rion. And I am no longer Klaire. I guess you knew that from before.&#34; His lips pursed into a wide smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I remember your name Amara.&#34; And with that I left, I also need to find something to get those children out. I went to the other rooms this time it was full of black blood. The same thing they used before, then the other rooms was also filled with children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went back to the hallway, I just need to check another, it was the darker corner of the hallway. It looks abandoned to me but I still need to check it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to take a step, I stiffen upon realization that someone is standing behind me and what&#39;s even worst is without even turning my head I already knew who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I swear I held my breath as soon as I heard those words from his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you even real?&#34; I remained silent, I wasn&#39;t sure if I could even face him right now. And if he was asking if I was real, I am real, which I hope was the other one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell me who are you! Why do you keep appearing in front of me!&#34; He shouted, his voice sounded like he was in pain. I wasn&#39;t sure how I should face him right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly turn around and regret it as soon as our eyes meet. My heart was pounding loudly in my chest, I was even afraid that he would hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made sure that I wasn&#39;t showing any emotions in my eyes. But it still feels we are the only people here which is partly true by the way. But it felt like I was being sucked up by his gaze. And all those emotions that I keep hiding and avoiding was now crawling back in my skin like it was telling me thag they are never gone in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a while Aiden.&#34; That name sounded foreign in my mouth but still familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure what to feel when we reach the East Mansion. Glancing at the familiar building, I couldn&#39;t help but think about the things we&#39;ve done here. I look up to where the Veranda is, where he usually climb off just so he could talk to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a deep breath, I started heading upstairs. I could feel his piercing gaze on my back. I have no idea why heas asking if I was real but I know it has something to do with what Zion said. And I don&#39;t know if I should feel happy about it or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at my left arm, it was bracelet that is used to chain me into this place. I haven&#39;t seen this things in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at him, he was only sleeping but why does it feel like he was in pain in his sleeps. I was really surprised after seeing him and the fact that he doesn&#39;t remember me. I wasn&#39;t sure if I was happy about that matter or even more pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and stared at my own reflection, what are you doing again Amara? Your plan here is to get Clint back but right now you are tied up with the Alpha who you are avoiding at all cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still unsure why he help me earlier, but I guess because of the fact that he couldn&#39;t remember me. I smiled bitterly at myself, getting all this emotions again after I tried to bury them out on the back of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure by this time they already knew that I was gone. And Clint, I haven&#39;t seen him. I know he wouldn&#39;t just act recklessly without a reason. So I wonder what was his plan for staying here. And I hope I was right about that matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm.&#34; I turn around to find him having a nightmare, I went to his side and his claws are digging to my flesh as I tried to wake him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything was okay, now just go back to sleep.&#34; He open his eyes for a second then started going back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really need to go right now. But before I could his hands reach for mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t leave me...&#34; He mumbled, still in his sleep. The familiar sparks erupted in my whole system just like the first time he held me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stroking his handsome face, I then gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just until you wake up.&#34; I whispered, and I stayed like that until an explosion happened, it was from the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! Clint!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glance at him then back to where Clint is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I jump of the veranda and started heading to where Clint was. When I got there I almost bend on my knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole place was already on fire, and I couldn&#39;t find Clint. When I got inside, the place was filled with corpses. Dead bodies of werewolves are all over the place. Walls was painted in red because of their blood. Claw marks was all over the place. And there weren&#39;t the normal one, this aren&#39;t just made by normal werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran further inside, following the strange noise coming from the other side of the hallway. It was the only part that I haven&#39;t checked earlier because he arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got there, my eyes widens upon seeing what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way.&#34; I whispered to myself as I glance at the creature that we all fear off. Werewolf like creature, black fur, red eyes. It was standing with its own two feet like, sharp claws that are quite bigger than a normal werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought it was only Kariz and I who was successfully became one? It growled as soon as it notice my presence. It was so loud that I know the whole pack probably heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at its arms, he was holding the unconscious Clint. I need to get Clint out of here. And the whole pack is endanger right now. I need to do something to this Lycan before anyone could get hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like how I did before, I let my rage took over. My hair turned back to its silver-white strands, as well as my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him down!&#34; I uttered as I stared at it, but strangely it didn&#39;t affect it. He growled once more before it started running towards me. And before I could react I was already hitting the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; I coughed out blood, I didn&#39;t even notice it&#39;s movement. Wiping the blood smudge in my mouth. I need to think quickly, my abilities seems useless with it. Emanating a golden light around me, I tried to focus it in one single place before throwing it to where it was. But instead of getting hurt it just resulted for it to get even more angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Physical strength, I was sure I couldn&#39;t match it. And without my abilities, I couldn&#39;t fight it. Except if I was able to turned into a Lycan. Which I have no idea how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide when it suddenly lifted Clint into its mouth. Was it about to eat Clint?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before I know it, I felt my whole body feels so light. Like I could easily move myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then something caught my eyes, it was my own reflection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a Lycan?</p>
