                <p>The first light of dawn painted the ruins in gold and crimson, stretching long shadows across the cracked stone. The world felt different now, heavier like the air itself was holding its breath, waiting for what came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stood at the edge of it all, her fire still burning low at her fingertips, her pulse steady despite the weight pressing down on her. The wolves behind her both the living and the dead, were silent, their golden eyes locked onto her, waiting for the command that would change everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent so long chasing the past, searching for answers, trying to understand why she had been erased. Now, she no longer needed to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And knowing meant there was only one thing left to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take it all back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped beside her, his stance steady, his golden gaze unreadable. But she could feel the shift in him, the way he stood closer now, not as someone waiting for orders, but as someone who had already chosen his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sure about this?&#34; he asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned her gaze toward the distant horizon, where the city of their enemies lay in the path of the rising sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They erased me,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m just returning the favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a sharp breath behind her, flipping a dagger between her fingers. &#34;God, I love it when you talk like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, fierce smile curled at the edges of Riley&#39;s lips, but the fire in her eyes didn&#39;t waver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will move soon,&#34; she said, her voice carrying over the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack straightened, their bodies tensing in quiet, sharp readiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been waiting for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for the day when they would no longer have to answer to the ones who had rewritten history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for the moment when they could finally become the war that had been stolen from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned, facing them all, feeling the weight of their trust settle against her ribs. She had never asked for this. Had never imagined herself leading an army of wolves both living and dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate had made its choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, so had she.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t stop until the city falls,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena grinned, sharp and wild. &#34;And when they beg for mercy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s fire flared brighter, the embers crackling between her fingers, her voice steady as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We remind them that we were never the ones who needed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dead wolves lifted their heads, their glowing golden eyes locked on hers, their massive bodies still as if waiting for something unseen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They howled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Low, deep, resonant, a sound that shook the very ruins beneath their feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living wolves followed, their voices rising into the air, merging with the howls of those long gone, creating a chorus that stretched across the land.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A declaration..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war had been waiting for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it has finally begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of their howls carried through the morning air like a storm breaking the silence before destruction. It was not just a battle cry, it was a reckoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere, far beyond the ruins, their enemies would hear it. They would wake from their false sense of security, feeling a chill crawl down their spines, sensing something shifting in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But by the time they truly understood what was coming, it would already be too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley could feel it, the slow, inevitable pull of fate drawing her forward. The past no longer felt like something distant, something unreachable. It was right here, woven into her, burning beneath her skin like a promise she intended to keep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran was still beside her, his golden eyes sharp, watching, waiting. He had always been a fighter, always been willing to stand on the front lines. But this was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just another battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the war to end everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war to erase the ones who had erased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war to rewrite history in her fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley took a step forward, feeling the power humming beneath her feet, in the stone, in the wind, in the wolves who had placed their faith in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We move at first light,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one questioned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they all understood what this moment meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There would be no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when the sun finally rose high enough to touch the ruins</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would not rise on the forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would rise on the ones who would never be erased again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire inside Riley pulsed in response to those words as if the ruins themselves agreed. As if the very earth beneath her feet had been waiting for this moment for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been erased once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been buried beneath history, forced to live in the shadows of a life stolen from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was the storm that would bring everything back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky above them stretched into a pale gold, the first hints of morning breaking against the horizon. The dawn of a new day. A new war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack remained still, their bodies poised, their golden eyes filled with something unchangeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t just wolves anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were an army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley was their war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s voice cut through the quiet, steady, low. &#34;When this starts, there&#39;s no stopping it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Then we don&#39;t stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes held hers for a long moment, searching for something hesitation, doubt, uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had already made her choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a sharp exhale, spinning a dagger between her fingers. &#34;God, I&#39;ve never been this ready to ruin someone&#39;s entire existence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other wolves shifted, their tension fading into something else anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they weren&#39;t afraid anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t waiting for someone else to lead them to a future they had been denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had already chosen their queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when they moved, when they struck when their enemies saw what had come for them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would finally understand that history does not forget forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let her fire burn brighter, casting flickering gold against the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are done waiting,&#34; she said, her voice carrying through the stillness, unshaken. &#34;We take back what was stolen. We destroy the ones who tried to erase us. And we do not stop&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward the city on the horizon, where their enemies slept, still believing themselves untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;until they know what it means to fear us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dead wolves howled once more, their voices weaving into the wind, into the land, into history itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world would remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in the fearful hush of a forgotten legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the echoes of their howls carrying through the land, reaching the ones who had buried them beneath lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, the earth trembled beneath their feet, no longer a graveyard but a kingdom waiting to rise again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack stood unwavering, their golden eyes alight with the same hunger, the same certainty that pulsed beneath Riley&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just about revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about reclaiming everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they were still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, they would tear down the ones who had dared to believe they were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped beside Riley, his golden gaze locked onto the city in the distance, the place where their enemies still sat in their stolen power, unaware that the past was clawing its way back to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was quiet, steady. &#34;They won&#39;t see it coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let the fire in her veins surge, bright and undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the point,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind shifted, carrying the scent of war, of change, of something inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more letting others decide the fate of those who had already lost everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had stolen their history, who had shaped the world in their image, who had spent centuries believing they had won</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were about to learn the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned toward her wolves, toward her army, toward the warriors who had placed their trust in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We take back our home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground pulsed beneath them, the ruins humming in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past was alive again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as the first rays of the sun finally broke over the horizon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So was she.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as the girl they had tried to erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as the forgotten queen buried beneath time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as something new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something they could never silence again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire beneath her skin pulsed in time with the rising sun, golden embers flickering against the ruins, dancing through the air like echoes of the past that refused to be buried any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was no longer just a reclamation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a resurrection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves around her both the living and the dead, felt it too. They stood taller, their bodies thrumming with the same unshakable force that surged through her veins. This wasn&#39;t just their war anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was their destiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind howled through the ruins, weaving between the crumbling stones like a final warning to those who had built their thrones on stolen power. The past was no longer sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran shifted beside her, his golden eyes locked onto hers, searching for something with some last trace of hesitation. But there was none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had made her choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she would make them all remember why they should have feared her in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley let out a slow breath, feeling the weight of centuries settles against her ribs, no longer a burden but a weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was quiet, but it carried through the ruins, steady and unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s end this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as the wolves began to move, their shadows stretching toward the war ahead</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world finally felt the return of a queen who had never truly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time, I will not be able to forget her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley took the first step forward, and the pack moved with her, their footsteps silent but heavy with purpose. The ruins no longer felt like remnants of a lost kingdom; they felt like a battlefield waiting to be claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind carried the scent of fire, of dawn, of war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could taste it on her tongue, feel it thrumming through her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No more playing by their rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world belonged to those who dared to take it, and Riley had never been more certain of what was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran walked at her side, his golden eyes dark with understanding, his body coiled and ready, like a wolf standing at the edge of the hunt. He didn&#39;t speak, didn&#39;t need to because he already knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena smirked, flipping a dagger in her hand. &#34;If we&#39;re doing this, let&#39;s make it hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dead wolves followed in eerie silence, their glowing eyes locked on Riley, waiting for her to lead them into the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would not stop until every last one of them burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world had tried to bury her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she would bury them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the first light of morning stretched across the land, Riley took another step forward</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with her, an army rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living and the dead, shadows of the past and warriors of the present, all moving as one. The weight of history pressed against them, but it did not hold them down, it pushed them forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The earth beneath them seemed to pulse with energy, with fire, with something old and unshakable. The ruins no longer felt like a place of loss. They felt like a starting point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rebirth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t look back. There was nothing left behind her, nothing worth remembering except the mistakes of those who had tried to bury her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their reign had ended the moment she remembered who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she took back her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ahead of them, the path to war stretched wide and open. The city where their enemies sat in comfort, still believing they were safe, still believing that time had done its job, still believing they had already won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s fire flickered brighter, hotter, hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this was not just about reclaiming what had been stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about making sure it could never be stolen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, her voice steady and sharp as a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We move now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as she stepped forward, leading them toward the first battle of the war</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world itself seemed to exhale as if it knew that the past had finally caught up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, there would be no mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only fire.</p>
