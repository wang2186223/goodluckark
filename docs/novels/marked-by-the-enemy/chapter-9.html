                <p>When I pushed the guest bedroom door open and walked inside, Nero&#39;s eyelids immediately raised and he swayed his gaze to the right, staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As our eyes locked, my lashes fluttered, and I froze, losing touch with reality for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened last night was extremely embarrassing now that I&#39;m back to my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that he was on the other side while I moaned that loud made me want to bury my face in a pillow and scream at top of my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Nero asked, tossing the sheet off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he got out of bed, and as I watched him walk over to the closet wearing only a boxer my words faded from my lips, and I swallowed hard, unable to draw my gaze away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His burly physique left me speechless, and my entire body jerked to a standstill unexpectedly as my heart pounded and my mind went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake,&#34; Nero called out to me, frowning as he looked back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh!&#34; I subconsciously mumbled, snapping out of my feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you are done peering, can you tell me why you are here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-ho sa..y I was star..ing? I wasn&#39;t looking at you! There&#39;s nothing attr-active on your body... to look at!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Neron took a sleeveless t-shirt out of his closet and wore it, he focus on me and sarcastically mumbled, &#34;Right,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, I wasn&#39;t!&#34; I whispered as I rubbed my neck, darting my eyes around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he grabbed his sweatpants out of the closet, he turned around and watched me for a couple of minutes as my fingertips slowly stroked against the skin of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he frowned at me and said, &#34;What else did you come to my room for other than stare at my...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said that I wasn&#39;t staring at your dipstick!&#34; I shouted, pulling my hand away from my neck and tightening my fingers into a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going to say, &#39;my face,&#34; Nero said, raising a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hastily looking away from him, I focused on the closet mirror and noticed that my face was flushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to hear a word from you!&#34; I harshly said, scowling at the half-smile on Nero&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stupid smirk on his face told me that he only changed his statement to poke fun at me, and I turned away from him, drew a deep breath, and said, &#34;I made breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, I hurried out of the room, feeling annoyed, and hearing his footsteps a few distances behind me only made me more irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived in the dining room, I froze in my tracks as I watched Jason scowling at me with a look of raw hate in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For several moments I stood unmoving, and my limbs went numb with absolute fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is he doing here?&#34; I whispered, barely able to get the words out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I texted him to come.&#34; Nero casually said as he took a seat at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaying my gaze on him, I opened my mouth to speak. But my words felt stuck in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of minutes of trying to get the words out, I finally mumbled, &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To watch over you while I&#39;m at work,&#34; Nero said with a frown on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need a babysitter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not here to babysit you, but to protect you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Protect me! He&#39;s going to end me before you get back home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room became voiceless as Jason and Nero narrowed their eyes at me as though I have said something stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I know the look in his eyes because I have seen that exact look in others&#39; eyes when they are mad and about to hurt me. So I knew not to overlook such a gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are being dramatic. He&#39;s not going to hurt or kill you.&#34; Nero sighed and said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even though I want to,&#34; Jason abruptly uttered without taking his icy gaze off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hair immediately started to tingle along the back of my neck after hearing those words, and I shouted, &#34;That&#39;s it! I&#39;m not staying alone with this maniac!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both of you, calm the fuck down!&#34; Nero shouted with glowing red eyes, and the room immediately became mute as I sealed my lips together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing Jason a hard look, he drew a breath, and said, &#34;Find. You can stay in the yard, and she can stay in the house!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason is a beta, and he doesn&#39;t seem like a stable one. So Nero&#39;s words didn&#39;t make me feel the slightest bit safer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still not okay with that arrangement!&#34; I muttered, darting my eyes away from Jason&#39;s straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, please, not now!&#34; Nero lashed out at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even though his eyes told me he was pissed and I felt a bit afraid, I clenched my fists and shouted, &#34;Fine! Leave me with this freak, and have yourself to blame if anything happens to me.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown crossed Nero&#39;s face as he slapped the table and yelled, &#34; well, this freak is the only person that I trust to keep watch over you! If I stay here to babysit you and we both go missing from the school, what do you think the damn rumors would be about?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering a word, I pouted, feeling a sense of annoyance mixed with embarrassment eating at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Jason glared at me, shoved his hands into his trouser pockets, and then mumbled, &#34;I swear on my life that she&#39;s safe with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a minute. Then I swayed my gaze on Jason and half-heartedly uttered, &#34;Well, if Nero counted on you so wholly, then I guess I trust you too because of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds passed and Nero continued to stay quiet, both Jason and I gazed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he ignored our stares and started slicing into his meat with a cold expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he was angry at both of us, Jason and I drew out chairs and quietly sat down. Then we focused on our food while avoiding making eye contact with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of minutes later, I was laying in the bedroom with my gaze centered on the chandelier when a knock drew my attention to the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the door opened, Nero walked inside and shut the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I gazed at him, I felt a sense of anger rising in me, and I screwed my face into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nero kept a calm face as he uttered, &#34;Can you make a list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is Jason&#39;s problem with me!?&#34; I blurted out, unable to keep my emotions suppressed any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darted away from me and settled on my bag. Then he walked toward the rack, pulled my backpack off its handle, and unzipped it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have never met him before so why is he so freaking angry at me!?&#34; I asked as I sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I was going to get left with some maniac, at least I needed a good explanation as to why he hates me so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining his silence, Nero took out my notepad and a pen. Then he properly placed my bag back on the rack before approaching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Write down your clothes sizes and items you will need for the two weeks you are going to be here, and I will get them for you,&#34; Nero said, tossing the notepad and pen on the sheet, in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity of this man was pissing me off so bad. But even though I knew not to push my luck and anger him twice a day, I still needed the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What! Are you not going to tell me?&#34; I uttered, ignoring the pen and notepad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of silent minutes, Nero sighed and said, &#34;He&#39;s not angry at you! He&#39;s just overprot&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Overprotective of you!? Spare me that bullcrap! I can tell from his eyes that he hates, hates me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With mad eyes, Nero threw me an icy stare and harshly said, &#34;Can you let this go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously!&#34; I shouted, giving in to my anger. &#34;Is it my father? Does he hate me because of my father!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I stared at Nero for a moment and then lowered my head as I mumbled, &#34;It&#39;s because of him, right? That&#39;s the only reason that makes sense right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It grew quiet, and even though I gave Nero a couple of seconds to answer me, he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I raised my gaze and said, &#34;I might be my father&#39;s daughter, but his sins are not mine to pay! He has already put me through hell! I don&#39;t want to get put back there for something that&#39;s his fault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to write the list or do you plan to live in my clothes for the next two weeks?&#34; Nero abruptly asked with a deadpan expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that I wasn&#39;t going to get an answer out of him, I grabbed the pad and pen. Then I aggressively wrote down some stuff on the blank sheet before handing it to Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A corner of his lips pulled upward as he took the notepad from me. Then after focusing on my eyes for a while, he withdrew from the bed and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Nero left the room, I took a pillow and silently screamed into it as I thought, &#39;Is my father the reason Jason hates me? Does Nero have a reason to hate me too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet these questions could only get answered by that annoying guy, and from the looks of things, it seems like he wasn&#39;t planning on telling me, and that only felt me more curious to find out what he was hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A perfect coincidence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>************Nero POV****************</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I came downstairs, I met Jason waiting for me at the bottom of the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my eyes fixed on him, I faintly smiled before walking past him. But Jason suddenly grabbed my arm, causing me to stop in my tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s only going to be here for two weeks, right?&#34; Jason asked, pulling his brows together in a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, I wasn&#39;t sure about the answer to that question either, and it annoyed me to know that I was being hesitant to decide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, I looked at the time on my phone screen and said, &#34;I&#39;m running late for class. So, let&#39;s catch up this discussion later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nero!&#34; Jason harshly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stared at him, his eyes told me that he was mad. But if he knew why I was this considerate to Blake, he would detest me, and I didn&#39;t wanted the one person that honestly cares about me to see me as the monster that I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jason squinted his eyes at me, I sighed and said, &#34;What is it now?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger in his eyes died down, and his expression softened as he said, &#34;I don&#39;t want you getting hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was I supposed to tell him that it was too late for me to care about my safety and that what my plans are will either land me dead or start a war that have ended centuries ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, I stared at my beta. Then I slowly pulled my hand out of his grip and said, &#34;Be nice to her. She&#39;s not her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like me and Jason, Blake was a victim of her father&#39;s brutality. But she was also a casualty of my beastliness. So if I was to transfer my anger for Loki onto her, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to her, and she would be dead by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, that would be compared to the worst thing that I have done to her in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After opening the front door, I looked back at Jason and said, &#34;I&#39;m not kidding. Don&#39;t lay a finger on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Jason didn&#39;t answer, I walked out of the villa, knowing that he wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I drove my car into the campus parking lot and got out of the vehicle. Then I narrowed my eyes when I saw Karen riding her convertible into the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting a second, I walked away from my car and headed into the building without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of minutes after I got to class, Karen walked into the classroom and marched up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Noble, take your seat. I&#39;m about to start my lecture!&#34; I said as I strived to maintain patience even though it was something I didn&#39;t have for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Nero,&#34; Karen said, acting as though she didn&#39;t hear a word that I just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your seat, Miss Noble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you lose up a bit, Nero!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding in my breath, I counted to ten in my head, using every a bit of my willpower not to lose control of my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit! Down!&#34; I firmly said, hardening my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of a giggle echoed in the room, and Karen hastily looked at her classmates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked back at me and softly uttered, &#34;You should be thankful that you are fucking hot, or else...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving me a soft smile, she twirled her hair as she took a long look at me before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had taken her seat, I let out a soft breath to try and calm myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I focused on my tablet and gazed at the words displayed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day went by naturally, and after I got done with my lecture, I left the classroom and headed into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking a few distances, I hardened my face when I picked up Karen&#39;s scent. However, I kept walking, pretending as though I didn&#39;t sense her a few steps behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to my car, Karen hurried towards me and then grabbed onto my arm as she mumbled, &#34;Mr. Fang, can we talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The last time I gave you my attention, you wasted it with useless remarks, so how about you spare me today,&#34; I said, yanking my hand out of her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why of all time, fate decided to entangle me with the wrong omegas and not the one I came here for!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Karen slightly clenched her fists and shouted, &#34;Did you hear that they are having a pack meeting today to officially chastise Blake!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I hesitated, clenching my jaws. Then I turned around to face Karen and asked, &#34;How is that my damn business, Miss Noble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After everyone in the pack knows that Blake is no longer a member, do you know what&#39;s going to happen to her?&#34; Karen coldly uttered with a straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t answer, she took a step towards me and whispered, &#34;She becomes a rogue. And members of the pack are going to hunt her down and kill her. That&#39;s the law. No wolf leaves the pack alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As I said before, &#39;it&#39;s not my damn worry!&#34; I said, feeling pissed that she was still bugging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smirking, Karen took a step back and then softly intoned, &#34;That&#39;s good. Because it will break my heart to see you get hurt or kill because of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time was twelve-fourteen on my dashboard when I brought my car to a stop in the parking lot of Divi shopping mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tightening my hands on the steering wheel, I glared at the enormous building before me and mumbled, &#34;Let&#39;s get this over with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear Blake got me doing things that I don&#39;t even do for myself. Is this my redemption price? Taking care of the omega that I have wrong deeply?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped my lips as I pushed the car door open and got out. Then I approached the mall, trying to convince myself not to turn around, drive away, and just let her live in my t-shirt and boxers for the next two weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I arrived inside the mall, and then my mind went blank when I suddenly realized that I was not shopping for myself, but for a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahaha, I&#39;m regretting this already!&#34; I murmured, unable to suppress my thought anymore as I walked further into the mall with my hands stuck in my coat pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked past stores, I kept looking at the transparent windows, hesitating each time to go inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I stopped in front of a boutique and my feet felt frozen to the floor as I stared at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clothes display at the window looked impressive, and the mannequin that wore them looked right about Blake&#39;s size, so I wanted to check it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to enter or not!&#34; A honeyed and yet harsh voice suddenly echoed into my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed by the aggression in her tone, I turned around and frowned as I stared at an attractive woman with ash brown hair, glossy skin, and red lipstick painted on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant our eyes locked, she smiled at me and said, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I recognized who she was, and the only thought that crossed my mind was, &#39;Luna Hayes. What a perfect coincidence!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew that the omega that I came all this way for was going to bump into me instead of me working my way to her as I planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enemy Territory</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt a bit annoying that fate kept messing up my plans, but now that I was staring at Luna, I felt like I was getting back on course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her eyes slightly dart left and right, I asked with a straight face, &#34;Do you tell your name to every stranger that you just meet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. But I make an exception if that stranger is a hottie like yourself.&#34; Luna said with a sheepish grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a bit straightforward, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see the crime in honesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring coldly at her, I paused for a moment before saying, &#34;I should get out of your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she was the one I needed to get closer to, I didn&#39;t want to make my intention too obvious, and it was clear from how she was staring at me, I had caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, stay,&#34; Luna abruptly said with a naive expression. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I furrowed my brows, she faintly chuckled and mumbled, &#34;I couldn&#39;t help noticing that you wanted to enter several stores, but you seem cautious to do so. Do you want to buy ladies&#39; wear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I hesitated to say it, I swallowed my pride and said, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Luna while shopping for her sister wasn&#39;t part of the plan, and a part of me wanted to ditch our little chat and meet her at an appropriate time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will it seem rude of me if I ask who you are shopping for?&#34; Luna abruptly said with a soft smile on her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words caught me off guard and without giving my answer a second thought, I blurted out, &#34;My sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated with myself, I tried not to show it and kept a casual look on my face as Luna stared at me with a hint of doubt in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sister?&#34; Luna asked, raising a brow. &#34;That&#39;sinteresting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she is my little sister, and she&#39;s coming to visit me this weekend. But she refused to carry luggage behind her. So she sent me a list of things to get for her before she gets here.&#34; I blurted out before clearing my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I swayed my gaze from Luna&#39;s doubtful eyes and thought, &#39;Does she believe me?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can just tell that you spoiled her,&#34; Luna said, and I gazed at the wide smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spoil her? Am I overindulging Blake with care? Sure, I&#39;m being lenient to her, but that is because I owe her, and not because I care or anything.  Yet, a part of me felt a bit different, and that was my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, she&#39;s the only woman in my life, so it seems logical to pamper her.&#34; I casually uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the truth and the only logical answer I could think of since that would be a lot more believable than anything else I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only one? What about your mother?&#34; Luna asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she suddenly clapped her palm over her mouth as she pitifully stared at me, as though she had finally realized what she had asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s dead.&#34; I casually uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talking about my mother doesn&#39;t draw out emotions in me because she died when I was only a pup, and although I feel sad, I don&#39;t know her, so there&#39;s no reason to mourn. But there is a revenge motive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Withdrawing her hand from over her mouth, Luna pouted and then mumbled, &#34;I feel so awful for asking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I said, giving her a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmh,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking intensely at me, Luna&#39;s eyes suddenly lit up, and she cheerfully uttered, &#34;Let me help you shop since it&#39;s obvious that you are shy to do it alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a terrible idea, and I slightly shook my head as I said, &#34;I can&#39;t.. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please!&#34; Luna firmly uttered. &#34;It&#39;s my way of making it up to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking one sister to shop for the other was a bad decision. But then again, I didn&#39;t want to leave an awful impression on Luna on our first encounter, so I went against my better judgment and said, &#34;Okay,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to head into the shop, Luna suddenly grabbed my arm, softly smiled, and whispered, &#34;Shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, I led her into the store and approached the front desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Hayes!&#34; The Cashier hastily said, standing to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at Luna, I met her eyes and mumbled, &#34;You seem like a famous person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. Are you going to continue pretending like you don&#39;t know who I am?&#34; Luna said, narrowing her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I knew who she was, and I have done my investigation on her. Luna Hayes, a spoiled, brutal princess of her father&#39;s castle, and she&#39;s the perfect key that grants me access to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m missing something here,&#34; I mumbled, furrowing my brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Hayes, the legitimate daughter of the leader of the dark moonlight pack?&#34; Luna said, looking a bit offended that I didn&#39;t know her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me for not recognizing such an important figure. To be honest, I am new in town.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahha, I understand now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Luna let go of my hand and mumbled beneath her breath, &#34;But what I don&#39;t understand is while you don&#39;t have a scent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like my identity, my scent needed to stay hidden because Loki knew it, and it would be a disaster if he discovered who I am before I found out the information I wanted to acquire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to pick up a few clothes,&#34; I told the cashier, ignoring Luna&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I rested my black card on the desk, and immediately the cashier&#39;s attitude towards me changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my. An unlimited black card. I will get our shopper to help you find our store&#39;s most luxurious items.&#34; She said with a big fat smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her, I studied Luna, and as she watched the cashier pick up the telephone, she rubbed her thumb against her index finger before mumbling, &#34;So, you are rich and have your scent hidden. I guess I&#39;m not the only important figure here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she swayed her gaze on me and asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unlike you, I&#39;m not a big fan of giving my identity out to a stranger, even if that stranger is a stunning lady like yourself.&#34; I casually uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should feel mad, but I&#39;m more interested in you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, my plans were falling into place smoothly, and the only thing that could make it fall apart was Blake, and right now, I&#39;m regretting allowing her to stay with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please meet, Dora. She would be the one showing you guys around the store.&#34; The cashier said when a lady approached us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a friendly smile on her face, Dora focused on me and said, &#34;Is there anything in particular that you are looking for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, I shoved my hand into my trouser pocket and pulled out a sheet. But as I was about to hand it over to Dora, Luna yanked it out of my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking one look at the sheet, she gazed at me and mumbled, &#34;Panties? You and your sister must be close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we are.&#34; I casually said, jerking the paper from her grip and then handing it over to Dora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown crossed Luna&#39;s face. But she said no words to me before looking the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I came out of the store, and a few feet behind me was Luna with a single bag in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, Luna followed me, and when I reached my car, I turned around to stare at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for helping me in there,&#34; I said, giving her a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was my pleasure,&#34; Luna uttered, her face lit up in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the boutique security guards approached us, and it grew silent between her and me when they came closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put it in the back,&#34; I said, pressing the button that opens the car trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the security guards had put in all the bags, he left, and Luna intensely gazed at me as she bit on her bottom lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she hesitated for a moment before saying, &#34;Do you want to go to an event with me tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it about?&#34; I asked, already having an idea of what she was going to say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of sadness settled in Luna&#39;s eyes as she stared into my gaze and said, &#34;My half-sister rebelled against the pack, and went rogue. So we are hosting a pack meeting this evening to officially announce her dismissal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shutting her eyelids, a few drops of tears rolled down her face as she mumbled, &#34;That&#39;s why I need moral support because tonight is going to be hard for me to handle. I&#39;m losing my only sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no secret to me about the bad blood between Blake and Luna because I have spies in their house, so her little show wasn&#39;t striking to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you did help me shop, so sure,&#34; I said. &#34;Text me the address, and I will be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking out her phone from her purse, Luna handed it over to me and watched as I typed in my contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I got done, I gave the phone back to her and said, &#34;It was nice meeting you, Miss Hayes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring intensely at me, she smiled and said, &#34;I prefer, Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then, see you this evening, Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, bye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Luna watched me as I got into my car. Then I drove off before I caught sight of her from my windshield, walking over to her vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After driving for a while, I brought my car to a stop on the side of the road, and then picked up my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds went by with me scrolling through my contact. Then I finally dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s new, son?&#34; A robust voice echoed into my ear, and I clenched my jaws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Hayes just invited me to an event,&#34; I finally gained the strength to say as I rested back in my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loki Hayes&#39;s daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line grew silent for a moment. Then I heard, &#34;I know this will help with the plan greatly. But be careful how you enter our enemy&#39;s territory and don&#39;t let your cover get exposed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know father. I just needed you to be aware that everything is on track and moving smoothly and there&#39;s nothing for you to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping silent, a look of worry spiked in me as a thought crossed my mind, &#39;Did Jason tell him about Blake?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad to hear that, son. The sooner you can accomplish step one of the plan, we can move on to the next phase.&#34; I heard my father say a moment later, and a sense of relief washed over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of your way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****************Blake Pov**************</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the shorthand on the clock hit seven and the long hand pointed at twelve, I stared away from the wall clock and looked at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I rolled over,  laid on my back, and slowly shut my eyelids,  blinking as my eyes adjusted to the bright chandelier light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to fall asleep when Nero was haunting my dreams, and it was even irresistible to ignore his scent, even though I was trying to since he arrived home a few hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the bitterness I felt finally left me, I dragged myself out of bed and headed in the hallway, planning on going downstairs for a cold glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I walked past Nero&#39;s room, I heard mumbling echoing from within it, and out of curiosity, I stood, grabbed the knob, and pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nero met my eyes, he placed his finger to his lip and frowned at me. Then he turned his back to me and said, &#34;Yes, I got the address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was annoying that he was shushing me, and although the thought of leaving crossed my mind, I found myself standing still as I stared adorably at all the tattoos on his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, It was like I lost control of myself, and I was standing outside of my body as I watched myself walk over to Nero. Then my hands slowly stroke over the serpent tattoo on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butterflies came in full force, and my heart pounded against my rib as my finger slowly caressed his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmmhmmh!!&#34; Nero moaned softly, and I hastily pulled my hands back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I took two steps back as Nero turned around and scowled at me with his lips pressed in a firm line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping my hand to my side, my lashes swept up, and I blinked a couple of times. Then I focused on the space between us, avoiding his fierce gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m fine.&#34; Nero calmly uttered with his eyes still glued to me. &#34;I will see you later tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I was curious about who he was meeting, I suppressed my desire to listen in on the conversation, but that didn&#39;t stop the energy from bursting through me, and I heard a voice that sent shivers down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he ended the call, I crossed my arms and asked, &#34;Why are you talking to Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be eavesdropping on others&#39; conversations, and learn to keep your hands to yourself!&#34; Nero said, and his smooth brow puckered in a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was Luna on the line, right?! Why are you talking to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a full-grown man, Blake. I don&#39;t owe you a damn explanation of what I do and don&#39;t do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I broke off eye contact with him and mumbled, &#34;Sure, whatever. You don&#39;t! Just answer this, and I will be on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Nero asked as his expression softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you tell her about me staying at your place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, bear with me a little. After two weeks, I will be out of your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It fell silent between us as Nero stared at me without saying a word. So I turned away from him and walked out, enraged at my heart for falling for that jerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the kitchen, I met Jason, and the moment his gaze rested on me, he narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you languishing over about?&#34; Jason asked as he picked the knife on the counter and then sliced it into his apple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you care?&#34; I mumbled, walking over to the cupboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right. I don&#39;t care. What I meant to ask was who is this Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eavesdropping! Ha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be a hypocrite,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I opened the cupboard and tipped toes to grab a glass, but they were a bit out of my reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of the way before you break something!&#34; Jason lashed out before reaching over my head and grabbing a glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I turned around to face him, and when our eyes locked, he gave a half-smile, twirled the glass in my face, and whispered, &#34;You want this? Tell me who Luna is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without replying to him, I turned around and stretched my hand to grab another glass. But Jason suddenly grabbed my wrist, and I pulled against his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, his hold on my hand remained firm, and I could feel his body slightly pressed against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go,&#34; I whispered, pulling my hand a bit hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Jason leaned toward my ear and whispered, &#34;Who&#39;s Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, my wolf awoke, and I had no control when I yanked my hand from Jason&#39;s grip before forcefully elbowing him in the mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he drew back and let out a soft cry, &#34;Fuck!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he settled the glass on the counter, and the moment he did, I walked over to it, and picked the glass up, ignoring the cut on his lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting a bottle from the refrigerator, I sat on a stool and pulled water into the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his eyes fixed on me, Jason aggressively wiped the blood off his lips and uttered, &#34;Your eyes you ar-e! Y-ou are You are supposed to be wolfless and weak! But the force you use just now It was...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caring not for the things he said, I drank a mouthful of water and held it in my jaws the instant I heard Nero&#39;s voice, &#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I stared away from Jason and focused on him, I choked on the water when I forced it down my throat and started coughing aggressively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay!&#34; Nero shouted, rushing towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I held out my hand in front of me and nodded hastily. Then I grabbed the glass and drank more water to calm down as my heart kept thumping wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Stop beating so damn fast. How can you have feelings for a man who doesn&#39;t feel the same way? Stupid!&#39; I lashed out in my head. But that didn&#39;t stop my heart from pounding louder when I looked at Nero again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I didn&#39;t know any better I would assume that it was trying to beat its way out of my chest!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Nero asked, his voice, tight with panic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I mumbled, setting the glass on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then for a while, I stared at his black neat-fit three-piece suit, then at his hair in a tight bun before gazing at his superfluity shoes and watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though it wasn&#39;t something that I wanted to admit, he looked really good, and just one look at him was giving me thoughts, dirty thoughts that I wasn&#39;t proud of at the very least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accidentally, I locked eyes with Nero again, and he uttered smoothly, &#34;You sure that you are okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop asking me the same thing over and over again! I am fine!&#34; I shouted, losing control of myself. &#34;Also, why are you overly dressed to meet my sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My damn wolf won&#39;t let me keep a piece of dignity with all this emotional outburst and attachment she has me feeling for Nero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna is your sister!&#34; Jason abruptly uttered, his voice like steel. &#34;Nero, what the hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare!&#34; Nero said in a deep, commanding voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked at Jason, I could tell from the look of rage in his eyes that he didn&#39;t only hate me, but my sister too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning, I overheard Nero telling him that I am not my father, and I can&#39;t help but wonder what my father did to Jason for Luna and me to earn so much hate from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two be good. I will be back, hopefully soon.&#34; Nero said, throwing me a hard look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear by our expression that neither Jason nor me was happy about him leaving. But Nero shoved his hands into his pocket and walked out, and I stared after him, pouting at the thoughts of what he and Luna would be doing tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I heard the front door slam shut, I picked up the glass and drank the rest of my water before slamming its bottom on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, the glass broke in my hand, and a piece of it tore into my palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with you?!&#34; Jason lashed out at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine! I will heal soon.&#34; I mumbled, gazing at the blood on my palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped his lips, and then the kitchen fell silent for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Luna is your sister?&#34; Jason asked, gazing directly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, I clutched my fist and lashed out, &#34;Yes! She is my perfect half-sister! She&#39;s everything that I will never be! My father&#39;s pride and joy! My stepmother gifted child! The pack promising leader! It&#39;s no surprise that Nero chose her over me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My emotions were eating at me, and it wasn&#39;t long before I busted into tears, crying at the top of my lungs while staring at Jason and deeply stiffing my snot back into my nostril.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he gazed at me, he looked so uncomfortable, watching me cry my eyes out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he darted over to the hooks on the wall and took out a white towel before walking back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dry up! You look ugly and disgusting when you cry.&#34; Jason said with a calm measured voice as he tossed the towel on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I pulled the towel off my eyes and threw him a dirty look before cleaning my face dry and blowing my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I looked at Jason and he was staring at me with pure disgust in his eyes. But in that instant, I realized that something was missing from his gaze. He didn&#39;t look hostile towards me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I now understand why Nero is considerate to you and not mad,&#34; Jason said with a faint smile on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mad? So he does have a reason to hate me!&#34; I mumbled, feeling a dull throb in my chest.</p>
