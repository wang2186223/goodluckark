                <p>&#34;Sally,&#34; Costin&#39;s warm breath caressed her face as her eyes blinked open, &#34;you need to wake up, gypsy lady. We are leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally&#39;s eyes popped open and she sat straight up. &#34;Leaving? What about Jacque and Jen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vasile instructed Decebel and Fane to get the others to the tavern. We are to meet them there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally pushed Costin back so she could stand up. She had fallen asleep in the clothes she&#39;d been wearing the day before. She ran her fingers through her hair, trying to untangle it, and blinked her eyes several times to get the sleep out of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m good. Let&#39;s go.&#34; Sally headed for the door of the room she had been sleeping in. Costin chuckled as he followed her. He grabbed her around the waist before she could pull the door open and she let out a surprised squeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Costin, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin turned her in his arms and held her close, breathing in her scent. He thought maybe it was beginning to change, but worried that it was just wishful thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to stay close to me. Do as I tell you and don&#39;t try to be a hero.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally snorted. &#34;You do realize that I&#39;m Sally not Jen, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin looked down into her warm, honey colored eyes. &#34;Yes, Sally mine. Believe me, I know the woman I hold in my arms. I also know that when it comes to your friends you will do anything. I&#39;m simply asking you to think before you act, and by think, I mean wait for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally smiled sweetly at Costin and patted his cheek. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize it until now but I have to agree with Jen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin cocked his head to the side. &#34;About what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is cute when you bossy werewolves actually think you will get your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin let out a low growl that brought a giggle from Sally. Finally, she relented as she rolled her eyes. &#34;Fine, I won&#39;t do anything rash. How&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better,&#34; he told her as he released her, following her downstairs to where the others waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vasile, Alina, Peri, Cynthia, Sorin, and Crina all stood in a circle in the large room. The fire still burned strong in the stone fireplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally, Costin,&#34; Vasile acknowledged them. &#34;It&#39;s time. Peri is going to cloak us. We must move quickly. There will be no time to stop and rest. Sally, if you get tired, I must insist that you allow one of us wolves to carry you on our back in our wolf form.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally&#39;s mouth dropped open. Costin used a finger to gently push her chin up as he chuckled. &#34;I will carry her, Alpha,&#34; he told Vasile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vasile let out a knowing smile. &#34;I figured as much.&#34; Costin looked up questioningly at his Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before an exchange could take place, Peri interrupted. &#34;Enough dillydallying. We need to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, the group headed out of the Fae cottage and toward the Veil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Vasile had ordered, they moved quickly. No one spoke. The males were scanning the skies and the forest around them continually as they continued toward their destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally could feel the magic in the air. She could feel Peri&#39;s cloak, but underneath it there was something oily that tried to cling to her. Sally had mentioned it quietly to Peri and she explained that the witch was looking for a healer, so her magic was tuned to find the healer and link her to the witch. This was why Sally got the feeling that it was trying to cling to her. Peri had reassured her that the cloaking spell would keep the witch&#39;s magic from sticking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After nearly eighteen hours on foot, Sally was growing very tired and very cold. Costin phased to his wolf form and knew that Sally must be more tired than she let on, because she did not argue with Vasile when he told her to get on Costin and hold tight. The other wolves phased as well and then their speed picked up. Peri didn&#39;t seem to have any trouble keeping up with the fast, nimble bodies of the wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally closed her eyes as she leaned her body against Costin&#39;s wolf, and clung tight as she felt the cold hair rush through her hair and sting her cheeks. She tried to imagine a time when she and her two best friends weren&#39;t fighting for their lives and realized it had been quite a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to what?&#34; Jen asked Decebel, her eyebrows raised. A crooked smile lifted on her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jennifer, behave and just do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen was laughing out loud now. They had awoken after just a few hours of sleep and Adam and Elle were creating a cloak to protect them as they made a run back to the village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just that it wasn&#39;t under these circumstances that I&#39;d expected to hear those words come out of your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel growled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque looked up at Jen and winked. &#34;What was your answer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen smiled. &#34;Come now, Jac. What else would a good little mate say to her man when he tells her to get on him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adam, who had been tossing a throwing knife in the air when Jen spoke, choked at her words and cut his hand. Rachel actually let out a bark of laughter with Elle right behind her. Jacque reached over and bumped fists with Jen, laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many different ways do you think he went over it in his mind to tell me I was going to have to be carried on his back in his wolf form like you two?&#34; Jen asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel was steadily growling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jennifer, enough of this. We must go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen ignored him as Jacque piped in. &#34;Should we go over all the possibilities?&#34; Elle, Adam and Rachel were laughing even as Fane and Gavril joined in Decebel&#39;s growling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, maybe we don&#39;t have time to go over all of them now, but I feel obligated in this dire situation, when we don&#39;t know if we will live or die, to share with you the words my mate spoke to tell me it was time to go. Drum roll, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel was snarling at his mate, who looked completely undaunted. Elle and Adam had two throwing knives each and were bouncing them off the cave walls in a drum roll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen imitated Decebel&#39;s deep voice as she spoke. &#34;Jennifer, wake up. You must ride me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The small cave erupted into laughter. Gavril and Fane, even in wolf forms, were letting out snorts through their muzzles. Rachel and Jacque were wiping tears from their eyes and Elle was holding her stomach as she bent over at the waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel sat down on his haunches and glared at the group, waiting for them to regain their composure.  He looked over at his mate, who, despite the fact that it was a joke of her own making, was blushing a beautiful shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go now?&#34; he asked dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen winked at him and made a motion toward the cave opening. &#34;Ready when you are, fur ball.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel snorted and waited for her to climb onto his back. Rachel and Jacque followed suit. Without another word, the wolves and their precious cargo charged out of the cave with the two Fae alongside them. They all ducked, expecting to be pelted by bats, but nothing happened. Jen looked up into the clear sky and squinted from the bright sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess she gave up,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Elle shook her head, &#34;she&#39;s regrouping. She&#39;ll be back.&#34; And with that, they were off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves ran at top speed, their mates clinging tightly to their fur, and the Fae steadily cloaking them as they went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen didn&#39;t know how long they had been running when, out of nowhere, they were suddenly surrounded by six more wolves, a tired looking Sally, and a fierce looking Perizada. Sally&#39;s face lit up like Christmas when she saw Jacque and Jen both holding tightly to their wolves in one piece. The group never broke stride as they met up, but continued to run under the cloak provided by the Fae until they reached the tavern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the males but Gavril loped inside the tavern door being held open by Skender and headed to find clothing to change into once they phased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Gavril can come with us to the meeting room in the back.&#34; Jen motioned them to follow her as Jacque, Sally, and the others moved ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in the meeting room, huddled around the large stone fireplace, Sally hugged Jen and Jacque fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you two to know that I&#39;m really mad at you, but so happy you&#39;re okay that I&#39;m willing to overlook it.&#34; Sally tried to look upset but couldn&#39;t pull it off. She was just overjoyed to see her two best friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re sorry that we didn&#39;t tell you, Sal.&#34; Jacque pulled Sally in for another hug as she spoke. &#34;We didn&#39;t want you to have to lie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque pulled back. &#34;You do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Sally nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; Jen asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little birdie told me.&#34; Sally winked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does this little birdie happen to pour vodka for a living?&#34; Jen smirked at her sweet-natured friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maaaaybeee.&#34; Sally grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room - which had slowly been filling up with pack members that the girls hadn&#39;t seen in weeks - suddenly went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vasile and Alina walked into the room with Decebel, Fane, Costin, Sorin, Perizada, Adam, and Elle all in tow. Skender pulled the doors shut, closing the room off from any prying ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Vasile made his way to the front of the room with his mate at his side, Decebel came up to Jen, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her close. Fane did the same with Jacque, and Costin stepped up beside Sally and winked at her, bringing a pink flush to her warming cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rachel,&#34; Vasile looked over at her and Gavril, &#34;if you would like to take Gavril, Peri will get him some clothes for him to put on. Then we can discuss the necessary actions which will soon take place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri walked over to Rachel and took her long-time friend&#39;s hand. Gavril attached his large wolf frame to Rachel and they followed Peri out. As soon as the doors were closed again Decebel spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are the other packs on their way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Vasile answered. &#34;I have called Dragomir, Victor, and Dillon. They should be arriving tomorrow or the next day.&#34; He took a deep breath, then addressed the rest of his pack. &#34;For those of you who have been holding down the fort, so to speak, I will share with you what has been happening. Then I will let you know who will be staying and who will be returning to the pack mansion. There will be no arguments about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Alpha,&#34; the room spoke in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vasile gave a brief summary of everything that had taken place, leaving out details of Jen&#39;s ordeal, which he didn&#39;t feel was the entire pack&#39;s business. He didn&#39;t go into what Peri and he had talked about regarding Desdemona wanting a healer, because he felt like that was on a need-to-know basis. Once he was finished, he gave Skender and Boian orders on who he wanted to stay and fight, and who he wanted to go back home. As Skender and Boian began to gather those who would be leaving, Peri, Rachel, and Gavril once again joined the others in the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Peri explained to me why she has kept you hidden all these centuries,&#34; Vasile told them as they came closer. &#34;I&#39;m honored to meet you, Gavril, former Alpha, and Rachel, healer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavril nodded once and Rachel gave a small smile to Vasile and then a larger one to Alina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina agreed with Vasile and hugged them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As much as I would love for us to get to sit and reminisce, there is just too much at stake and so we must move forward.&#34;  Vasile paused and looked past Rachel and Gavril. &#34;Sally,&#34; he called to his healer, &#34;please join us up here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally looked at Jen and Jacque, who both nodded at her to go. Costin stepped up next to her and took her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got you, Sally mine,&#34; he whispered as he led her to the front. Sally looked behind her to find Jacque and Jen grinning from ear to ear. She just shrugged at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Costin pulled Sally to stand in front of him but he did not step away. Vasile raised a single eyebrow at him. Costin simply grinned, showing the dimple in his right cheek, and winked. Vasile shook his head with a slight chuckle and directed his attention to Sally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally, this is Rachel.&#34; Vasile indicated the older healer. &#34;Peri tells me that she needs to speak with you two alone. She also needs to put a stronger cloak over you two because your combined healing magic is like a beacon to the witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Sally. &#34;It&#39;s such an honor to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally looked up at Rachel when she released her from the hug. &#34;Are you kidding me? I&#39;m just a 17-year-old kid. You&#39;ve got centuries of experience as a healer. I assure you, the honor is mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri pulled the two ladies along with her as she muttered over her shoulder, &#34;You both should be honored because you get to spend time with me. Now, get over your sweet natures and come with me. We have the demise of a bitch - I mean, witch - to plan&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen laughed as they watched Sally and Rachel follow Peri out of the room. &#34;Man, that fairy is my kind of chick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, a mouthy one?&#34; Decebel grumbled as he pulled her tighter to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri took Rachel and Sally upstairs to a room on the far corner of the tavern, away from where all the wolves had gathered. She turned and looked at both healers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, you two. Have a seat.&#34; She motioned to two chairs that sat next to one of the single beds in the large bedroom. &#34;We have a lot to cover and not much time. Consider this a cram session on healer history 101.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Rachel, I&#39;m sure you are familiar with the story on how the Canis lupus were created, correct?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sally, do you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We learned a little when we first moved in with Fane&#39;s family, but not all of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I will get you up to speed.&#34; Peri went on to explain to Sally all about the Great Luna in the moon, who had decided that humanity was corrupting itself, and how she loved the wolves and wanted to prevent them from extinction, so she joined the human spirit with the wolf spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, you might be asking yourself where the gypsy healer plays into all this. Well, hold onto your girdle, because I&#39;m getting there.&#34; Peri took a seat on the bed opposite the two healers and looked over their heads off into nowhere. Her face got that far away look that often slips across someone who is remembering a time long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Healers came about because the Great Luna wanted her wolves to appreciate the gifts she had given them. The ability to heal quickly, the blessing of children, the completeness of pack. A healer helps keep the harmony within the pack. The gypsy healer can mend injuries or illnesses that a wolf doesn&#39;t seem to be able to heal on their own. Also, a gypsy healer guarantees a successful pregnancy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that revelation Sally&#39;s jaw dropped open. &#34;A gypsy healer can what?&#34; She asked shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can ensure that if Jacque or Jen ever get pregnant, they will have a healthy pregnancy - one that is carried to term.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, no pressure or anything,&#34; Sally muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those reasons don&#39;t explain why the witch wants to get her hands on one or both of you,&#34; Peri continued. &#34;Desdemona isn&#39;t truly helping Thad, she&#39;s just using that as a front. You see, the blood of a healer is powerful. Witches&#39; magic, death magic, requires blood. There is nothing more powerful to a witch than the blood of a gypsy healer. The goodness and purity that runs in you makes your magic more powerful than any black magic. It&#39;s in your very essence. Unfortunately, like so many good things, it can be corrupted and used for evil once it&#39;s no longer inside you. That is why she wants you and will do anything to get you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally was quiet as she processed all of that information. She knew that she should be worried, or maybe even scared of this Desdemona, but all she could bring herself to feel was anger and outrage that this witch would dare to hurt Sally&#39;s friends to get to her. She would do whatever was necessary to protect those she loved, and if Peri said that Rachel and her had powerful magic that could defeat the witch, then that&#39;s what they would use to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, what do we need to do?&#34; Sally asked eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No time like the present and we can&#39;t change what is, so we might as well get busy taking care of business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rachel smiled at Sally, then looked at Peri with determination. &#34;I agree with Sally. Tell us what we must do to defeat this evil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri rubbed her hands together and the smile that stretched across her face gave Sally chills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent,&#34; the fairy murmured. &#34;Let&#39;s get started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel took Jen by the hand after Peri and the healers had left the meeting room. He tugged her behind him, leading her out of the room and upstairs. He brought her into one of the rooms that had two rows of beds in it, shut the door, and faced her. Jen saw that his eyes were glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything okay, B?&#34; Jen asked tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel took slow steps toward her, closing the distance between them. Jen knew better than to back up from a predator - all that did was encourage the chase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was standing so close that their faces were mere inches apart, he took a deep breath in through his nose. His eyes closed and he looked as if he were savoring it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was so worried about you,&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Dec. I didn&#39;t mean to worry you, but someone had to go and get Rachel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel growled. &#34;And that someone just had to be you?&#34; His voice was low and tight. She could feel the rage rolling off of him. &#34;Hours before you left, I had held your lifeless body in my arms, mourning you. HOURS, JENNIFER,&#34; he roared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen squeezed her eyes closed as she felt his turmoil pass through their bond. She had not only scared him, but terrified him that something would happen to her. Decebel knew there were worse things than death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped even closer and placed her hands on either side of his face, waiting for him to open his eyes. When he finally did, she reached out to him through their bond and tried to make him feel just how sorry she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t think. I didn&#39;t consider how my actions would affect you. Please, please, don&#39;t be angry with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel wrapped his arms around Jen&#39;s waist and pulled her flush against his body. He leaned his head down and pressed his lips to hers. The kiss was fierce, intense, and showed just how much he needed her. One hand ran up her back and wrapped around the nape of her neck, holding her where he wanted. He deepened the kiss as he slipped his tongue in her mouth and they both let out desperate groans. He began to push her back until the back of her knees hit one of the beds. Slowly, he lowered her onto her back and blanketed her body with his own, never breaking the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen&#39;s hands left his face and traveled to his strong shoulders and then back up to his neck, wrapping her arms around him and pulling him close. Jen pictured them in her mind, showing him how she saw him, and how he made her feel. She pictured what she longed for as his mate and wife, and nearly grinned when she felt a low growl in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just mean, Jennifer,&#34; he spoke into her mind with a groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just being honest. I need you, Decebel. Don&#39;t you need me?&#34; Decebel heard the fear of rejection in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Need you, want you, more than anything.&#34; Even through their bond Jen could tell he was breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel broke the kiss and began placing lighter ones along her jawline down to her neck. Jen pulled her head back, giving him better access. Decebel growled in response to her submission. He kissed the mark at the bottom of her neck and continued kissing down her collarbone and across the swell of her breast. Jen held her breath at the feeling of his lips and warm breath on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jennifer,&#34; he whispered against her skin. &#34;Breathe, baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gasp escaped her lungs, feeling Decebel slowly raise her shirt and begin kissing her along her right side where the markings that matched his climbed from her hip to under her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel chuckled when he heard her whimper as he gently nipped her skin with his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, much to her frustration, he pulled her shirt back down and raised himself on his forearms to look down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you. I want to make love to you. But I&#39;m not about to do it in a tavern full of Canis lupus, in a room with multiple single beds. I can assure you that I&#39;m suffering more than you by waiting, but I won&#39;t have my mate&#39;s first time be anything less than perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I be upset with you when you say something like that to me?&#34; she pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel leaned down and kissed her slowly. When he pulled back, he grinned at her. &#34;You can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dec,&#34; the tremble in her voice had him looking into her mind, &#34;I love being in your arms. I&#39;m so happy I&#39;m your mate, your wife. I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel ran his thumb gently across her well-kissed lips and whispered through their bond, &#34;You are mine, as I am yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen nipped his lips with her teeth, bringing a rumble from his chest. &#34;Don&#39;t you forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day Jen and Jacque sat on one of the couches in the meeting room, watching as Vasile talked to the top males in their pack. The tavern was abuzz with preparations. Some of the pack members were helping Nicolae prepare food for the coming packs, others helped wash dishes that had been dirtied from breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really feel like I should be up making myself useful,&#34; Jen said as she watched the others scurrying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, well, that would kind of be hard for you to do since your mate won&#39;t let you out of his sight,&#34; Jacque pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is that,&#34; Jen agreed dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of, how are you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen&#39;s eyes lit up as she looked over at Decebel, who was standing in a way that kept her in his line of sight while he discussed something with Sorin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re good. He&#39;s bossy, possessive, and broody.&#34; Jen grinned as she saw Decebel raise a single eyebrow and look up at her. She knew he would hear her. &#34;But I wouldn&#39;t change a thing about him.&#34; She tore her eyes from her mate and looked at Jacque. &#34;I&#39;ve never felt so treasured, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Completely understand,&#34; Jacque said as she grinned at her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen and Jacque jumped up when they heard loud voices coming from the other room. Both girls began moving in the direction of the noise, but were brought up short when Decebel and Fane were suddenly in front of them. The doors to the meeting room opened and they recognized Dragomir, the Hungary Alpha, walk in followed by members of his pack. Right behind them was Victor, Alpha of the Bulgarian pack, and his pack members, and then Dillon, the Colorado pack Alpha, with his pack, pulling up the rear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque stepped around Fane and made her way over to her dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; she said, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey yourself.&#34; Dillon smiled back and pulled her into a hug. &#34;You okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacque stepped back from him and felt Fane wrap an arm around her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good. It&#39;s been a rough few weeks, but we&#39;re all in one piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dillon looked past Jacque at Fane. &#34;Good to see you, Fane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dillon.&#34; Fane nodded in acknowledgment and added, &#34;We appreciate your assistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will always come if my daughter is in danger.&#34; Dillon smiled once more at Jacque and then made his way to Vasile and the other Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen and Decebel stepped up next to Jacque and Fane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen nudged Jacque. &#34;You seen Sally?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s working with Rachel and Peri again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s hope that fairy has some tricks up her sleeve. I have a feeling we&#39;re going to need them,&#34; Jen muttered, then nearly jumped when she heard Peri&#39;s voice from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;ve got more than tricks, mate of Decebel. I&#39;ve got legends come to life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri made her way quickly to the front and pushed through the other Alphas, ignoring their snarls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vasile, we need to talk. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vasile looked at the others. &#34;I apologize, gentlemen. If you will please give me just a few moments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three Alphas muttered their consents and turned to clear out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vasile then addressed his wolves. &#34;Romanian pack, if you would please step into the other room for a few moments. Thank you all for your help and patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The area began to empty. Peri turned to see who still remained and rolled her eyes when she saw all the ones who had been with her across the Veil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suppose nothing I can say will get you lot out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel stepped forward. &#34;If this has to do with any of us in this room, then we stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally and Rachel entered the room. The look on Sally&#39;s face told them something was up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay, Sal?&#34; Jen asked, her eyebrows raised in question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sally swallowed with some difficulty before she spoke. &#34;It&#39;s just a lot to take in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri looked at each person in the room, pausing briefly on their faces before she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Desdemona -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we weren&#39;t supposed to speak her name.&#34; Jen interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri frowned at her. &#34;At this point it&#39;s not a concern.&#34; She waited, watching Jen to see if she had a response. Naturally, she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see. Okay then, you may proceed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri snorted and rolled her eyes. &#34;Desdemona,&#34; she began again, &#34;is not going to play fair. Sally, Rachel, and I have been seeking out her intentions and what we have found is disturbing. Just like she used the animals in the forest to attack, she is amassing an army of animals to do her bidding. She is more powerful than I imagined if she can control so many at once. Wolves, bears, birds, wild boar, lynx, foxes, deer, and anything else she can get to obey her.&#34; Peri turned to look at Vasile. &#34;You know what I&#39;m going to ask of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their mates will never agree,&#34; Vasile told her, and the glint in his eyes said that he himself did not agree either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, wait, wait. Let&#39;s call a timeout on the clock.&#34; Jen took a step forward, which was matched by Decebel, who stood behind her with a hand on her hip. &#34;This has to do with us, as in myself and Jacque, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly is it we won&#39;t agree to?&#34; Decebel spoke over Jen&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri squared her shoulders as she looked Decebel in the eye. &#34;Your mates must join the battle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decebel and Fane both snarled at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They cannot fight. They are human - the wolves would tear them apart.,&#34; Fane growled at the Fae. His blue eyes glowed dangerously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are incorrect, prince,&#34; Peri challenged. &#34;They are not fully human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying?&#34; Decebel asked as his hand tightened on his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m saying that your mates also have Canis lupus blood in them. They have a wolf inside, a wolf that can be drawn out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jen&#39;s breathing sped up and she felt her chest tighten. She looked over at Jacque, who had an identical deer in the headlights look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying what I think you&#39;re saying?&#34; Jen asked apprehensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peri nodded as she moved to stand in front of the two girls. &#34;I&#39;m saying you can phase.&#34;</p>
