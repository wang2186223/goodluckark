                <p>&#34;They suspect that both of you are involved. And they will do everything to get you out of your hiding place.&#34; Lindon said, she look at him with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I cannot let that happened. Lindon you have to save him. He was innocent. If I have to go back just to exchange his place I will.&#34; She said fully determine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that they will kill you both even if you confess that you are the only one involved with the Rogues. They killed the others already.&#34; This time she fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only did what he have told me to do. He said that once I help him get Rion to take her with him, he will help me and Dieter be free from the Factions grip.&#34; Lindon came closer to her and pulled her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know what you all been through even though we all grow up together.&#34; He mumbled, while stroking her hair to calm her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud growl erupted in the air, and it was coming from Zion. I almost laugh at his reaction, because I have that same reaction whenever some touch her. When he realized what he have just done he turned his back on us and told us that he will wait for us at the entrance of the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone is jealous.&#34; Arren mumbled. I even heard Zion muttered the word shut up before he completely left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now we have to know why the faction started experimenting with human kids like us before. Something is telling me at the back of my mind that I already know the reason. I can only think of the Lycans, Belerick have the same purpose before. He wanted power and the first thing for that to happen is have his own army of Lycans who are the most mystical creation of the Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came closer to her, she was still crying but she was more calmer this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you heard them talking about the Lycans. Can you tell me everything you heard?&#34; She look at me confuse but then nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was during the night after our first shift, before they took us to the South I heard them saying that we are far from being a Lycan. They even said that the blood inside us was not enough to turn us into a complete Lycans. And mentioned someone named Belerick? Who knows where the blood of the Lycans is located. That was all I heard because they took us away that time.&#34; Belerick, just hearing his name made me clench my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So they know him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like you all got here first.&#34; We all turn our heads towards Cameron and Harid. Cameron was dragging Dieter in his left hand. He was unconscious while Harid was pinning Zion&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even notice them coming. And before we could react someone appear behind their back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How disappointing my Grandson. I know you are planning something but you surprised me with this.&#34; Hunter was smiling at me. How did he know we were here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes snap at Lindon who stood up and walk towards them. You traitor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did a very good job Lindon. I will make sure that you will be the next Alpha.&#34; He mumbled, I gritted my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Elder, I just did what I have to do for the Faction.&#34; I was about to rush forward. But someone stop me. It was her, she was shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you try to attack them. They will kill them both.&#34; She mumbled, her eyes were focus on Zion and Dieter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lindon you bastard! I know we couldn&#39;t trust you in the first place!&#34; Zion shouted, but then Harid used his knees to hit Zion right in his stomach. Which made him crouch in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, be quiet Zion. I wouldn&#39;t want to get more upset than I am now.&#34; Hunter mumbled. His eyes were directed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to kill us now?&#34; I muttered and he started laughing. Arren help Devon get up and we all stood there facing them. The other Elders were no where to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not. We both know you are an important key towards our plan.&#34; He mumbled, I didn&#39;t say anything. What is he planning now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh common Dwayne don&#39;t be like that. I know who you really are or should I call you Aiden? To lessen the confusion.&#34; My eyes widen at his words. The others look surprised except for him and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you knew all along.&#34; I mumbled, he nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first I didn&#39;t know about it, but when I saw you for the second time after you fully grown. I know I can&#39;t be mistaken. I wouldn&#39;t forget your face, because you were there during the second war.&#34; How come I didn&#39;t saw him that time? But then I remember something. There was a child among the faction that time. I almost didn&#39;t notice or remember it if not for today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See, I told you I know your little secret. Especially about the Lycan blood that you and the other Royalties have.&#34; He said, I didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and don&#39;t try to fight me Dwayne. I still have your mother. If you don&#39;t want anything bad to happen to her you will come to us quietly.&#34; I clench my fist at his words. He even tried to blackmail me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now please take that girl, we still need her alive in order to find those bastards. &#34; Someone from Cameron&#39;s group walk towards us and pulled Devon&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey let go of me you jerks!&#34; She tried to yank her arm away but it was no use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch her!&#34; It was Zion looking deadly. I shake my head at him. Telling him not to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe you did this Lindon! I hate you!&#34; She spit on Lindon&#39;s face but he just wipe it off and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how hard it was to live in the low ranks. And even after I became a Beta they still look down on me, snickering behind my back and now once I became their Alpha I&#39;ll make sure that they will pay for looking down at me. &#34; He uttered, she started laughing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if your father will be proud after knowing what you have done.&#34; And with that she received a loud slap from Lindon. This time Zion cannot contain himself, letting out a loud growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you not to touch her!&#34; His words were deadly, his breathing hardened, as his wolf ready to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zion no!&#34; I shouted but I was already too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted to his wolf, attacking the first werewolf beside him. He bite his shoulders before he could even react and throw him to the cliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claus step forward this time. &#34;Are you just really going to let them threatened you?&#34; He uttered looking at me from his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, just say a word and we won&#39;t think twice.&#34; Darren mumbled, then stood beside me. Arren nodded his head and took Darren&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha or not, we will stand by your side to protect our Alpha.&#34; Arren uttered, I shake my head not believing what I&#39;m hearing from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion&#39;s wolf was standing right in front of us. Devon was now being held by Lindon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zion, do as you please.&#34; I mumbled, his wolf smirk, letting our another warning growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made a big mistake Dwayne.&#34; Hunter mumbled, he was glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be the one saying that.&#34; And with that I shifted to my wolf. The others followed. His pupil widens when he finally saw my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harid and Cameron quickly shifted along with their people. Their wolf are almost the same as mine but mine is still bigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zion quickly rush towards Lindon who is now holding Devon in his arms. But before Zion reach him one of their werewolves jump to stop Zion. But knowing him, he just jump behind him and scratch his back using his claws. Claus used this diversion and attack Harid but Harid was fast enough to dodge it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful, they are still Alpha&#39;s.&#34; I reminded them all, they all nodded their head and shifted their attacks. This time Claus is fighting Harid with Arren. While Darren was Helping Zion. We are outnumbered by them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scan the whole grounds looking for the only person in mind. But he was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looking for someone?&#34; Cameron voice, I turn around to see him walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t want to waste my time with you Cameron.&#34; He just laugh at my words, among them Cameron was the happy go lucky, just like the people of the West. You may think that they are harmless among the Faction, but that was all wrong they are very cunning and troublesome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Dwayne I always find you interesting. I always want to fight you and see what you really got behind your sleeves. But then I found out that you are reincarnated? That made me more obsessed with the idea of fighting you.&#34; He started laughing. His wolf was snarling at me. Showing me his canines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder how much information do they know. I remember what he said about the Central Kingdom being attacked. I&#39;m sure they are also behind it. And it seems like he have read my mind and just blurted out my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh by the way, we attacked the Central Kingdom. Of course, we killed everyone. But then your friends made it really hard you know? If it weren&#39;t for that thing we wouldn&#39;t even last against them. But then thanks to him we were able to get what we need.&#34; He stop for a second then. &#34;I think one of them died during that time?&#34; He added, this time I cannot stop myself and rush forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly aim for his abdomen but he dodge it before my claws could even landed on him. He then move his head to bite me legs but I kicked him. He stumbled on the ground. Shaking his head when he stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used this chance to jump behind him. I landed right on top of him, pinning him on the ground, my weight was resting on his back while my legs are right between his, making sure he wouldn&#39;t be able to move. He tried biting my neck but he failed and this time I bite his right shoulder, he let out a loud whine, I let my canines dig deeper into his flesh. Feeling the metallic taste of blood in my mouth. My wolf smirk, thinking that he was nothing but words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sure once I let him go, his shoulder will have a permanent scar in it. When I was about to move to his neck another wolf went flying towards me. A loud thug erupted in the air as we both landed on the large tree. It was Arren, I push him aside. His wolf was bleeding heavily. I glance at them Zion was also cornered by Lindon and the other Darren was already back on his human form. Zion was now protecting him from the other wolves. While Claus was still fighting Harid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Cameron&#39;s direction, he was now back on his feet. If we continue to fight them, one of them will end up dying for sure. And I cannot let someone die again because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arren, make sure to get the others to run away from here. Claus and Zion can still make it. You all have to get out of here.&#34; I mumbled, he shifted to his human form and stared at me with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save your energy, make sure to do as I say.&#34; He wanted to argue but then nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I rush towards Zion, I attack the first wolf that caught my eye. They didn&#39;t notice me and were all surprised to my sudden attack. I glance at Zion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get Devon and Darren, then get out of here.&#34; He was surprised by my sudden appearance but nodded his head. Lindon was about to stop him but I blocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I&#39;m sure Zion got Devon and Darren, I used my body to blocked their attack. I snap the head of the other wolf that I caught and swing him in the air, making him land at Lindon who was already heavily injured because of Zion. Arren was now moving towards Claus. Harid was too distracted with my sudden intrusion with their fight. Before they realize what we are planning I was already in front of them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arren and the others were already running towards the entrance. Harid was about to stop them but then Hunter suddenly show up again. I didn&#39;t even saw him earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough Harid, let them. We already have what we need.&#34; He uttered while smiling at me. &#34;You did the right choice.&#34; He added, My wolf does not like my idea but ended up giving up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted back to my human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure to leave them alone.&#34; I muttered, he just nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, now you have to come with us.&#34; He ordered someone to chain me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really just going to leave them like that Elder?!&#34; Cameron voice was full of rage as he glared at me. He was mad about his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough Cameron! He was more than enough.&#34; He mumbled, pointing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough Cameron, the Elder is right. If you continue fighting against him. You won&#39;t be standing here anymore.&#34; He didn&#39;t say anything and just walk away. Harid was also full of bruises, but compare to Cameron who almost lost his arms, his bruises was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all started walking back down the mountain, but then a loud howl made me stop my track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirk when I finally realized who it was. Looks like they made it...</p>
