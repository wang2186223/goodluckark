                <p>The room grew hushed as the council considered her words. Sophia may have noticed the eyes in the room shifting between her and Tharros as the tension increased. She could see they were paying close attention to her right now. They had always respected her, but now they were looking for something more-something she hadn&#39;t noticed within herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;International relations are essential,&#34; Sophia continued. &#34;However, we must recognize that the effects of the Leviathans extend beyond physical strain. It has touched the hearts of everyone around us-both allies and foes. We want to understand the mystery behind it, the mysterious forces at play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, his eyes fixed on her. &#34;We will not do this by ourselves, Sophia. We want you. no longer just as a frontrunner, but as someone who understands the alchemy that connects the water and the leviathan. Your connection with it... It&#39;s what will guide us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach constricted. She had been avoiding thinking about the magic, about her new relationship with the leviathan. It becomes toxic, ingestible, and increasingly potent with each passing day. She considered using it to guard Aquaria. But what if that electricity arrived at an unsustainable price?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand what you&#39;re asking,&#34; Sophia said, her voice trailing off somewhat. &#34;But I won&#39;t be able to manage it. It is an excessive amount of. The strength, the connection-it is astounding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did it earlier,&#34; Tharros replied carelessly. &#34;You&#39;ve accomplished things that others couldn&#39;t. Sophia, your link to the Leviathan is the key. &#34;We have all seen it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She peered across the table, gathering the gazes of each council member. There was a quiet, silent acceptance of the truth in their eyes, but it also grew filled with expectation. They wanted her to take the reins and guide them through the pandemonium.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, how could she lead them if she felt out of control?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The discussion went on, each selection weighing heavy in the air. Sophia&#39;s thoughts raced as they discussed potential alliances, commerce routes, and naval techniques. Throughout it all, the fundamental issue-the Leviathan&#39;s effect-loomed over everything. Each decision they took appeared to push them closer to a tipping point, and no one was sure which way the scales would fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt exhausted when the council finally disbanded, as if the electricity had been sapped from her. She needed to leave, ponder, and breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stuck to her as she exited the council chamber. &#34;Sophia, wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her heart racing in her chest. &#34;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m the ideal person for this. &#34;I can&#39;t bear the weight of it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved closer, his stare steady and unrelenting. &#34;You are the only one who can do that. We all feel the weight, but you&#39;ve demonstrated time and again that you have the strength to carry it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shook her head, tears threatening to fall. &#34;But I&#39;m not only bearing the weight of Aquaria anymore. I, too, am carrying the leviathan&#39;s burden. It&#39;s my inner self, Tharros. I&#39;m not sure how much longer I&#39;ll keep it at bay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed his hand on her shoulder, grounding her. &#34;Then let us help you. You don&#39;t need to convey it on my behalf. &#34;We are always with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a minute, they stood silent, the weight of his words sinking in. Sophia was unaware of the fate that lay ahead. She wasn&#39;t sure if she could keep Aquaria secure, or if the leviathan would eventually eat everything she adored. However, for the first time in a long time, she allowed herself to believe in something other than fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Sophia stood at the edge of the palace, watching the first stars appear in the sky. The sea spread out before her, calm yet gloomy. The leviathan remained beneath the seas, as did Aquaria, who maintained her status and continued to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no solutions, no clear path forward. However, for the first time, she felt a stirring deep inside her-an electricity that came from grappling with the abyss, both in terms of status and darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she knew she had moved into gear. She was prepared to deal with whatever happened next. Now, not just for Aquaria, but also for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she began to go back inside, she heard it-smooth at first, a faint rumble in the distance. The leviathan growls. It was a promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The storm was not over. However, they were prepared to face it head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unveiled Edges</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s boots boomed across the dim hall, his feet crisp against the polished coral floorboards. He ran backward and forward, his heart racing as ideas collided in his mind. A warrior by blood and subject, he rarely allowed emotions to overrule his common sense, but tonight he became exclusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros had been silent about Sophia for too long, and Kael couldn&#39;t ignore the rising tension between them. This wasn&#39;t just about the Leviathan or Aquaria; it was about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open behind him. Kael paused, turning swiftly to watch Tharros enter the hallway. The Dragon King&#39;s visage became as serene as ever, but his eyes revealed the storm boiling within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael,&#34; Tharros said, his deep voice carrying the weight of centuries. &#34;We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael squared his shoulders, his azure green gaze fixed on Tharros. &#34;speak? Or are you here to explain your use of her as a weapon rather than a person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; brows furrowed together, and his lips tightened into a narrow line. &#34;Think about your tone, warrior. You forget who you&#39;re addressing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know exactly who I&#39;m speaking to,&#34; Kael said again, getting closer. &#34;And maybe that&#39;s the problem. You believe that if you studied, you could command everyone, including her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; jaw tightened, and his implementing discern exuded authority. &#34;You suppose you study and understand her better than I do? You&#39;ve been thinking about her for months, Kael. I&#39;ve felt her connectedness to the world long before you even&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t approximately who met her first!&#34; Kael interrupted, his voice rising. &#34;It&#39;s similar to how she feels now. And just now, she is being thrashed below your expectations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air around them became heavy, crackling with unspoken anxiety. They had been titans poised on the edge of a battlefield, neither prepared to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Tharros could respond, a silky voice broke through the charged silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;sufficient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men turned to face Sophia, her figure framed by the soft glow of bioluminescent coral. She wore a modest robe, her hair cascading about her shoulders, but it was her gaze that stopped them cold-stern, determined, and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This ends now,&#34; she murmured, taking a step forward. &#34;i&#39;m not a prize to be fought over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael opened his mouth, but Sophia lifted her hand to hush him. &#34;No, concentrate on me. Both of you. If this link between us comes to mean something, it was first valued. For me. For every other. &#34;Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros sighed slowly, his expression softening. &#34;Sophia, we simplest need to defend you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you watched this facilitates?&#34; She inquired, her voice harsh but not rude. &#34;I can&#39;t command Aquaria or face the Leviathan if you&#39;re constantly fighting. &#34;We&#39;re stronger together, but only if we act like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael looked aside, remorse flaring in his eyes. &#34;You&#39;re correct. I let my delight get in the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, hesitantly. &#34;As did I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia moved between them and placed a hand on each of their shoulders. &#34;Let this be the end of it.&#34; &#34;We have bigger battles to fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, the council room grew strangely silent, with the usual hum of pastime replaced by a palpable sense of apprehension. Sophia sat at the top of the table, flanked by Tharros and Kael. The council members, a mix of merfolk, sea witches, and various Aquarian leaders, observed her with interest and anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia took a long breath to stabilize herself. &#34;We&#39;ve been behind schedule with this conversation long enough. The Leviathan remains a threat, although it is no longer the most effective one. &#34;We need to prepare for what&#39;s coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin, sitting across the table, leaned forward. &#34;So, what exactly is coming? &#34;The Leviathan has not moved in days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia responded, &#34;That&#39;s what concerns me.&#34; &#34;It is too quiet. I&#39;ve been sensing something. A draw from deep within the water. It&#39;s difficult to explain, but it&#39;s more than just the Leviathan. &#34;There is something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs spread around the room. Tharros cleared his throat, catching their attention. &#34;Sophia&#39;s instincts have shown to be reliable before. If she detects a totally new threat, we must take it seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the elder council members, a grizzled and well-known mer, grimaced. &#34;So, what do you recommend we do? Mobilize our forces? Is there any likelihood of scaring the Leviathan further?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned his look, her demeanor friendly. &#34;No. We want statistics first. If something is available, we want to recognize it before taking action. That is why I am proposing an excursion to the Abyssal Trench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted with protests and whispers. The Abyssal Trench became a site of folklore and fear, rumored to be the source of the Leviathan&#39;s power and home to unimaginable beasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not possible,&#34; one councilor stated. &#34;no person who&#39;s ventured there has lower back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is why we need to head,&#34; Sophia argued. &#34;If we don&#39;t recognize what we&#39;re up in opposition to, we&#39;ll be preventing blind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros lifted his hand to silence the room. &#34;Sofia is correct. This is a chance we should take. And I can lead the day trip myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Sophia said firmly. &#34;I&#39;m going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went hushed again, astonished by her announcement. Tharros became to her, his face a blend of admiration and concern. &#34;Sophia, you don&#39;t need to&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, I do,&#34; she added. &#34;This is not only about Aquaria. This is about me. My relationship to the Leviathan, to the ocean-it&#39;s all related to whatever is down there. I need to recognize it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stood with his voice steady. &#34;Then I&#39;m going with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros followed suit. &#34;As am I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin smirked in her seat. &#34;Nicely, it appears we have our team. &#34;This should be thrilling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Sophia found herself on the royal balcony, staring out at the vast expanse of the sea. The superstars shimmered above, their light reflecting off the tranquil seas, but her thoughts had been anything but peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A familiar figure approached, and she turned to see Kael standing a few feet away. His usual confidence was replaced by something quieter and more vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t sleep,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled softly and gestured for him to join her. &#34;Neither ought to I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood side by side in quiet for a second, the tension from before remaining like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia,&#34; Kael began, his voice low. &#34;I apologize for how I acted. I let my emotions get ahead of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him, her expression warm. &#34;I recognize. However, Kael, we cannot allow our feelings for one another to cloud our judgment. We need to be stronger than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, his gaze focused on the horizon. &#34;I simply... I don&#39;t want to lose you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t,&#34; she murmured calmly, placing her hand on his arm. &#34;But we need to tackle this together. anybody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, an unexpected rumble resonated from the waves below. Their eyes widened as the tranquil waves began to churn furiously. A sickly green mild pulsed beneath the surface, becoming brighter with each passing two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros appeared in the back of them, his look severe. &#34;The Leviathan,&#34; he announced. &#34;It&#39;s stirring again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael drew his blade immediately, his protective instincts heightened. &#34;What&#39;s taking place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grabbed her chest as a sharp anguish surged through her, and the warmth of her connection to the ocean burned stronger. Her voice became barely a whisper, but it was heavy with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no longer simply the Leviathan,&#34; she remarked, her eyes wide with terror. &#34;some thing else is awakening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alchemy of the Unknown</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s pulse quickened as the glittering inexperienced light of the water faded into the horizon. She grasped the balcony railing, her mind racing as she attempted to sense the Leviathan&#39;s draw. It was no longer just a feeling; it had become a living, continuous bond that grew stronger with each passing second. Her chest constricted. Every instinct told her that the time had come to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s voice lowered as her thoughts spiraled. &#34;you could sense it, can&#39;t you?&#34; She requested, coming out of the palace&#39;s shadows. Her tone softened, yet there was a harsh part beneath it. &#34;The Leviathan&#39;s strength is asking you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her voice just above a whisper. &#34;It&#39;s adore, it&#39;s the within me. But I don&#39;t know what it requires.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s face stiffened, her dark eyes gleaming like the ocean&#39;s depths. &#34;Then it&#39;s time to find out.&#34; &#34;Include me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without expecting an answer, Arin became and began walking towards the distant end of the castle, her movements practical. Sophia paused for a brief moment before following. The frigid air bit at her pores and skin as they descended into the heart of Arin&#39;s mythical grove, which she&#39;d only heard tales of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia had never seen anything quite like the grove. Towering coral formations pulsed with a subtle, bioluminescent glow, sending shifting patterns of light and shadow over the enormous space. The air seemed alive, charged with a force that made her pores and skin tingle. It wasn&#39;t just magic; it transformed into something older, more primordial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin moved toward the center of the grove, her presence imposing. &#34;That is where the strains blur,&#34; she explained, pointing to the brilliant coral around them. &#34;Magic and nature, technological know-how and chaos-all come together here. If we&#39;re going to acknowledge your link to the Leviathan, this is the place to do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia made a timid step forward, her gaze darting over the grove. &#34;I don&#39;t know if I can do this,&#34; she said. &#34;Magic is not...logical. It does not follow policies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin smirked, her lips curled into a knowing smile. &#34;That&#39;s where you&#39;re mistaken. Magic has its own good judgment-you simply have to focus on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grimaced and crossed her fingers. &#34;and how precisely am I imagined to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin lifted an eyebrow, her attitude combining relaxation and assignment. &#34;near your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia hesitated, but eventually obeyed. When her eyes closed, the arena around her appeared to alter. She may want to feel the grove&#39;s pulse-a steady, repetitive beat that resonated in her chest. It was weak at first, like the distant crash of waves, but it grew stronger as she targeted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;desirable,&#34; Arin said gently. &#34;Now, give permission to pass on everything you believe you know. Avoid striving to research and instead...experience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia inhaled deeply, feeling the grove&#39;s power rush over her. It became unlike anything she had ever experienced: fluid and unpredictable, yet unmistakably alive. It swirled around her like a living thing, brushing against her skin and straining at the edges of her consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Magic isn&#39;t simply power,&#34; Arin insisted. &#34;It&#39;s intentional. It responds to thoughts, emotions, and instincts. You may not be able to manipulate it, but you can guide it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia exhaled gently, her hands quivering as she reached into the swirling modern. The magic hesitated, darting away like a scared fish, but she kept her actions mild and coaxed it closer. The strands of mild gradually drifted closer to her, surrounding her palms like ribbons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re doing it,&#34; Arin said, her tone tinted with joy. &#34;Now, hold it regular.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia focussed, her heart beating as she tried to maintain the connection. It was both exciting and terrifying, like walking a tightrope across a limitless abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed as they worked, Sophia&#39;s scientific precision blending with Arin&#39;s flowing spellwork. They collaborated to produce a hybrid version that struck a delicate balance between structured algorithms and free-flowing mysticism. It was not easy. Sophia&#39;s attempts to pin down the magical currents were futile because they were continually altering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Magic doesn&#39;t like being forced,&#34; Arin informed her, watching as one of Sophia&#39;s outfits collapsed in a flash of light. &#34;you need to adapt to it, not the opposite way round.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grumbled and rubbed her temples. &#34;this will be so much less difficult if it accompanied some form of pattern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin grinned, her voice taunting. Who says it doesn&#39;t? Perhaps you&#39;re just looking in the wrong spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grimaced, her thoughts racing. What if Arin proved to be right? What if the patterns were altogether different-something natural-rather than linear? She closed her eyes once more and let her mind drift. Slowly, the chaotic currents began to take shape in her mind, connecting with something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly she felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weak but amazing pulse beats in tune with her heartbeat. It wasn&#39;t coming from the grove or the magic around her; it was coming from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s eyes snapped open. &#34;There is something...inside me. I will sense it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s expression became grim. &#34;The Leviathan,&#34; she replied gently. &#34;Its energy is tied to yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach churned as a wave of horror and realization washed over her. &#34;How? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin shakes her head. &#34;I do not comprehend. However, if we recognize the relationship, we may be able to predict-and prevent-its activities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s medical knowledge proved useful as they worked on their paintings. She used her hydrodynamics knowledge to map the Leviathan&#39;s energy pulses, flawlessly integrating them with Arin&#39;s spell matrices. The end result was a shimmering three-dimensional depiction of the sea&#39;s currents, with each pulse extending outward like ripples in a pond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s heading for the trench,&#34; Sophia said, her voice tense. &#34;but why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s gaze clouded. &#34;The ditch is ancient.&#34; It&#39;s older than Aquaria and the Leviathan itself. It can&#39;t be exact about what it&#39;s looking for there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s chest tightened. The thought of the Leviathan achieving the ditch caused her with fear that she couldn&#39;t explain. &#34;We have to prevent it,&#34; she insisted forcefully. &#34;before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded, but her expression remained bleak. &#34;It&#39;s not clean. The closer you get, the stronger your relationship becomes. If you&#39;re not careful, it may eat you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia swallowed hard, the weight of Arin&#39;s words settling on her. &#34;Then I&#39;ll need to be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia noticed something strange while they were packing their equipment. Her arm, where the Leviathan&#39;s pulse had been greatest, began to sparkle softly. She drew up her sleeve to reveal a delicate, intricate rune engraved into her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin,&#34; Sophia replied, her voice trembling. &#34;what&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes widened, and her usual serenity slipped. &#34;That...shouldn&#39;t be possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rune pulsed, its glow becoming brighter as Sophia&#39;s connection to the energy around her became stronger. It felt alive, like an insignia or a seal, and it burned with such intensity that it became inextricably linked to the Leviathan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it mean?&#34; Sophia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s gaze was distant, and her expression unreadable. &#34;It method you&#39;re extra connected to the abyss than any folks realized.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s pulse raced as the ramifications sank in. The Leviathan was more than just a risk; it had become a part of her, and it would not let her cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Dragon’s Choice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rune gleamed softly on Sophia&#39;s arm as she exited the grove, her mind jumbled with possibilities she couldn&#39;t help but clutch close. Tharros waited for her near the royal gates, his imposing parent highlighted by the delicate bioluminescent glow of the coral streets. His golden eyes searched her, detecting the faint uneasiness she tried to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been with Arin,&#34; he said, his voice calm but questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded and pulled her sleeve down. &#34;We&#39;ve made progress. The Leviathan is going into a ditch. &#34;We think we can track it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros examined her, his expression opaque. &#34;What about you?&#34; Did she tell you how perilous this link is?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s eyes hardened. &#34;I already recognize. However, this is not about me; it is about each individual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips form a thin line. &#34;You&#39;re too quick to undergo the weight by myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re too short to think you have to control everything,&#34; she blasted again, her tone constant but pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stiffened, a hint of defensiveness crossing his face. &#34;manipulate is what continues us alive, Sophia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step closer, her voice lower but no less company. No, trust is. If we don&#39;t start relying on every different, this component will harm us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following their altercation, Tharros retreated to the palace school grounds, her sentences chasing him like an unbreakable shadow. The vast arena shone softly in the moonlight, its sides covered with the shimmering scales of young dragons eagerly awaiting his teaching. Their wings glinted in the dim lighting, restless and alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had trained dozens of them, turning their skills into sharp weapons for Aquaria&#39;s protection. These days, however, their intensity irritated him. He stood in the midst of the ring, his imposing presence drowning out their murmurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Form ranks,&#34; he instructed, his tone stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The younger dragons obeyed, their movements rushed and chaotic. One stumbled over its tail, prompting a pointed scolding from its companion. Tharros frowned, inflammation rising beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awareness,&#34; he said abruptly. &#34;Your energy means nothing with out discipline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dragons froze up, scolded. Tharros sighed privately, his tone rougher than he had expected. He turned his back, his thoughts going to a memory he rarely allowed to surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years before, Tharros had stood in a similar ring, but on the other side of the command. His father&#39;s voice reverberated throughout the neighborhood, each word laden with authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;strength is the whole lot,&#34; his father had remarked, marching ahead of the line of younger dragons. &#34;Strength comes from control. If you can&#39;t control your strength, you&#39;re susceptible. &#34;If you percentage it, you&#39;re silly.&#34;</p>
