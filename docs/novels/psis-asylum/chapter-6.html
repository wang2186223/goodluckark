                <p>It felt like I was boiling from the inside out. It was December, and the Factory couldn&#39;t have been warmer than forty degrees, but lines of sweat were racing down the curves of my cheeks, and I felt a hard, stiff cough welling up in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a light touch at my side. Sam couldn&#39;t look up from her own work, but I saw her eyes slide over to me, trying to assess the situation. A wave of furious red was making its way up from her throat to her face, and I could only imagine the kinds of words she was holding back. Her bony elbow brushed against mine again, as if to remind me that she was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with agonizing slowness, I felt the same PSF move behind me again, brushing my shoulder and arm with his own as he gently deposited the boot back on the table in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These boots,&#34; he said in a low, purring voice as he tapped the plastic bin containing all of my finished work. &#34;Did you lace them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I hadn&#39;t known what kind of punishment I&#39;d get for it, I would have burst out into tears. I felt more stupid and ashamed the longer I stood there, but I couldn&#39;t say anything. I couldn&#39;t move. My tongue had swelled up to twice its usual size behind my clenched teeth. The thoughts buzzing around my head were light and edged with a strange milky quality. My eyes could barely focus now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More snickers from behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The laces are all wrong.&#34; His other arm wrapped around my left side, until there wasn&#39;t an inch of his body that wasn&#39;t pressed up against mine. Something new rose in my throat, and it tasted strongly of acid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tables around us had gone completely quiet and still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My silence only egged him on. With no warning, he picked up the bin of boots and flipped it over, so dozens of boots scattered across the length of the table with a terrible amount of noise. Now everyone in the Factory was looking. Everyone saw me, thrust out into the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!&#34; he sang out, knocking the boots around. But they weren&#39;t. They were perfect. They were just boots, but I knew whose feet would slide into them. I knew better than to screw it up. &#34;Are you as deaf as you are dumb, Green?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, clear as day, low as thunder, I heard Sam say, &#34;That was my bin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And all I could think was No. Oh no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the PSF shift behind me, pull back in surprise. They always acted this way-surprised that we remembered how to use words, and use them against them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the insult rising to her lips. She was rolling it around on her tongue like a piece of hard lemon candy. &#34;You heard me. Or did inhaling that polish kill whatever helpless brain cells you had left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what she wanted when she looked over at me. I knew what she was waiting for. It was exactly what she had just given me: backup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung back a step, crossing my arms over my stomach. Don&#39;t do it, I told myself. Don&#39;t. She can handle it. Sam had nothing to hide, and she was brave-but every time she did this, every time she stood up for me and I shrunk back in fear, it felt like I was betraying her. Once again, my voice was locked away behind layers of caution and fear. If they were to look into my file, if they were to see the blanks there and start looking into filling them, no punishment they&#39;d give Sam would ever compare to the one they&#39;d give me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what I told myself, at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The right side of the guy&#39;s lips inched up, turning a grim line into a mocking smirk. &#34;We&#39;ve got a live one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come on, come on, Ruby. It was all in the tilt of her head and the tightness of her shoulders. She didn&#39;t understand what would happen to me. I wasn&#39;t brave like she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wanted to be. I so, so wanted to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t. I didn&#39;t have to say the words aloud. She read it easily enough on my face. I saw the realization come together behind her eyes, even before the PSF stepped forward and took her arm, yanking her away from the table, and from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turn around, I begged. Her blond ponytail was swinging with each step, rising above the shoulders of the PSFs escorting her out. Turn around. I needed her to see how sorry I was, to understand the clenching in my chest and the nausea in my stomach had nothing to do with the fever. Every single desperate thought that ran through my head made me feel sick with disgust. The eyes that had been on me lifted two by two, and the soldier never came back to finish his personal brand of torment. There was no one left to see me cry; I had learned to do it silently, without any fuss, years ago. They had no reason to so much as look my way again. I was back in the long shadow Sam had left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The punishment for speaking out of turn was a day&#39;s worth of isolation, handcuffed to one of the gateposts in the Garden regardless of the temperature or the weather. I&#39;d seen kids sitting in a mound of snow, blue in the face, and without a single blanket to cover them. Even more sunburned, covered in mud, or trying to scratch patches of bug bites with their free hands. Unsurprisingly, the punishment for talking back to a PSF or camp controller was the same, only you also weren&#39;t given food and, sometimes, not even water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The punishment for a repeat offense was something so terrible, Sam wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t talk about it when she finally returned to our cabin two days later. She came in, wet and shaking from the winter rain, looking like she had slept no more than I had. I slid off my bunk and was on my feet, rushing to her side, before she had even made it halfway across the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand slipped around her arm, but she pulled away, her jaw clenched in a way that made her look almost ferocious. Her cheeks and nose had been wind-whipped to a bright red, but she didn&#39;t have any bruises or cuts. Her eyes weren&#39;t even swollen from crying, like mine were. There was a subtle limp to her walk, maybe, but if I hadn&#39;t known what had happened, I would have just assumed she was coming in from a long afternoon of working in the Garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sam,&#34; I said, hating the way my voice shook. She didn&#39;t stop or deign to look at me until we were by our bunks, and she had one fist curled in her bedsheets, ready to pull herself up to the top bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say something, please,&#34; I begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stood there.&#34; Sam&#39;s voice was low and rough, like she hadn&#39;t used it for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t have-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chin came down to rest against her chest. Long, tangled masses of hair fell over her shoulders and cheeks, hiding her expression. I felt it then-the way that the hold I had on her had suddenly sprung free. I had the strangest sensation of floating, of drifting farther and farther away with nothing and no one to cling to. I was standing right beside her, but the distance between us had split into the kind of canyon I couldn&#39;t jump across.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; Sam said, finally. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have.&#34; She drew in a shuddering breath. &#34;But then, what would have happened to you? You would have just stood there, and let him do that, and you wouldn&#39;t have defended yourself at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then she was looking at me, and all I wanted was for her to turn away again. Her eyes flashed, darker than I had ever seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can say horrible things, hurt you, but you never fight back-and I know, Ruby, I know, that&#39;s just how you are, but sometimes I wonder if you even care. Why can&#39;t you stand up for yourself, just once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was barely above a whisper, but the ragged quality to it made me think she was either going to scream or burst out into hysterical tears. I glanced down to where her hands were tugging at the edges of her shorts, moving so fast and frantic that I almost didn&#39;t see the angry red marks that circled her wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sam-Samantha-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want-&#34; She swallowed, hard. Her tears caught in her eyelashes, but didn&#39;t fall. &#34;I want to be alone now. Just for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t have reached for her, not with fever and exhaustion pressing down on me. Not while I was trembling with a bone-deep hate for myself. But I thought, ththen, that if I could tell her the truth, if I could explain, she wouldn&#39;t look at me that way again. She would know that the last thing-the absolute last thing-I ever wanted was for her to be hurt because of me. She was the only thing I had here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second my fingers touched her shoulder, the world dropped out from under me. I felt a fire start at the ends of my hair and burn its way through my skull. The fever I thought I had kicked suddenly painted the world a fuzzy shade of gray. I was seeing Sam&#39;s blank face, and she was gone, replaced by white-hot memories that didn&#39;t belong to me-a whiteboard at school filled with math problems, a golden retriever digging in a garden, the world rising and falling from the perspective of a swing, the roots of the vegetables in the Garden being pulled free, the brick wall at the back of the Mess Hall against my face as another fist swung down toward me-a quick assault from every side, like a series of camera flashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when I finally came back to myself, we were still staring at each other. For a second, I thought I saw my horrified face reflected in her dark, glassy eyes. Sam wasn&#39;t looking at me; she didn&#39;t seem to be looking at anything beyond the dust floating lazy and free through the air to my right. I knew that blank look. I&#39;d seen my mother wear it years before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you new here?&#34; she demanded, suddenly defensive and startled. Her eyes flicked down from my face to my bony knees, then back up again. She sucked in a deep breath, as if coming up for air after a long time beneath dark waters. &#34;Do you have a name at least?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ruby,&#34; I whispered. It was the last word I spoke for nearly a year.</p>
