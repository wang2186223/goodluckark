                <p>Yustef&#39;s P.O.V</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t surprised anymore to see her here. She was standing beside Ali, avoiding my gaze as I watch her. I wasn&#39;t even listening anymore towards what Kariz was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yus, focus.&#34; Noah whispered as he notice my gaze was focus only in one direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klaire was nowhere to be found because that is exactly what we want to do. Especially after we heard the real deal of the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Clint told us that he saw Amara turned into a Lycan, I know that what will happened next will result to a different matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kariz told us that the only way to make Klaire control her Lycan was to return everything back. This is what we will discuss now. And she wasn&#39;t aware about any of this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you be sure that when we returned everything back will actually lead for her to retain her humanity?&#34; Noah mumbled, among us he was the most suspicious about Kariz intentions and we cannot blame him after everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest I wasn&#39;t sure.&#34; He answered but then stop for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the reason why Amara was more blood thirst and powerless against her Lycan was because she wasn&#39;t complete. I&#39;ve read a book before that a Lycan must be complete. As you are all not aware of Belerick is not the first one who planned on awakening the Lycan Clans. Their father was the one who originally planned this, experimenting on his own children, Belerick was one of them. Until their Father succeeded and he finally created one but his shift was unstable. And can you all guest who it was?&#34; We remained silent the whole time. This is the first time we heard about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was our father, the great King Elijah. And the reason why he was trying to find the place where the Lycans are sealed was because he wanted to put an end to it. He saw the danger of his destructive power. And he doesn&#39;t want anyone to use that power into negative ways. Belerick didn&#39;t like that idea which resulted to killing them. And if you are asking why a Lycan was overpowered by Belerick is because Elijah was able to sealed his Lycan. I don&#39;t know how which is why I need your help to find that book.&#34; He was able to sealed it? Then it only means. Kariz nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to sealed her Lycan.&#34; That doesn&#39;t make sense. He did all this to awaken her Lycan back but why was he doing this now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Compared to me, Klaire was the main key to the awakening of the Lycans. That is also the reason why by just using his blood you are all able to become a werewolf. And that is also the reason why the Faction want her.&#34; I stop him for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying that all the things you said to Klaire was all a lie?&#34; I was very confused right now. I glance at Clint who is not saying anything about this. So it only means he was aware about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not all, I really do plan to destroy the Faction because that is the only way for her to live peacefully.&#34; He answered, I cannot contain myself anymore and walk towards him and punch him in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you be so selfish? You manipulated and deceived us and now you are telling us that all this time everything you did was actually for her sake.&#34; I cannot stop myself. Clint pulled me away and Eliot help him while Kariz just stood there letting me punch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough Yustef, I know you are angry but this is the only way.&#34; I pulled away from them and walk back to my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize for deceiving you all but I had no other choice. I couldn&#39;t tell you anything because if you all knew then you will also end up sacrificing yourselves for her.&#34; He uttered, and for the first time. He sounded like the little kid we know back in the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frightened kid that is full of bruises and trembled everytime we appear in front of him. And also the kid that brought smile towards us, the sweet innocent child that only looks for someone&#39;s love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After everything I&#39;ve done to all of you before. You all deserve to at least live a normal life even though it didn&#39;t last long but I cannot delay it anymore because Amara was showing more progress of her awakening.&#34; He added, I didn&#39;t say anything anymore and just listend to his plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here we are again hiding everything towards Klaire. I just hope she could forgive us this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we are done, I was about to go to Klaire when Ria pulled me to the side. I was surprised to see her. Her Hazel eyes were glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you agreed to it?!&#34; She was shouting now. I grabbed her and pulled her a bit to the corner making sure that Klaire wouldn&#39;t hear us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it matter? Everything originally belongs to her.&#34; I answered, I couldn&#39;t focus on her anger. My eyes lingers in her red lips, her short red hair was smelling like strawberry. She never change at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Hazel eyes was furry as she heard my response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you just do that? Does it matter? Of course it matters!&#34; I was stunned to her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you just be so selfish to decide to let your life end this way! You know you could die by giving everything back to her!&#34; She was now shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me!&#34; She was now punching chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you do it!&#34; Her tears started flooding her eyes. And it broke me to see in this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just pulled her hands and do the only thing that I wanted to do when I first lay my eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed her, at first she was hesitant but then gave up. The pull we had towards each other was too strong. And I finally gave in to the temptations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we separated, we were both gasping for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stared at her hazel eyes, remembering the first time I lay my eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>3 years ago...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliot and me stop at the near by town to investigate the case about the abduction. There were some reported cases about missing children and we hurriedly went here to investigate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We will stay in this town to get more information because after our whole night of searching we found nothing. Even Eliot&#39;s ability can&#39;t find anything. It was like someone is blocking us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Noah and Clint went to the other town to investigate. I watch as human lives continue, clueless about the harm that this world had. They are the weakest one, but what makes them unique is their abilities to cope to everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just watching the little child walking with his hand around his father and mother&#39;s hold. They look like they just had a great time. It made me wonder if my parents are still alive will they held me like that when I was a kid? My mother died giving birth to me and my father was too busy treating me like I&#39;m dead until the day he died, during that attack. Well, I can&#39;t blame him because I was the reason of why my mother died. Klaire always told me that it wasn&#39;t my fault but I can&#39;t help but blame myself. In my past life I don&#39;t even remember my own parents and nothing change in this life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shift my eyes and found a woman wearing a red coat, she was also wearing a cap around her that I can&#39;t see her face. Her clothes match her hair. I don&#39;t know why, but something inside me is telling me to follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Eliot uttered, but I ignore him and continue following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She soon approaches two kids, they look like beggars, dirty clothes with their little box on the sidewalk where they were standing. Is she one of them? I slowly made my way towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here use this money to get somewhere to sleep and get yourself some fresh bread and warm soup. It&#39;s cold out here.&#34; I heard her mumbled and the little kids made their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long are you going to follow me mister?&#34; She turn around to face me. Her hazel eyes where suspicious yet they took my breath away. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t notice this earlier but she was a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprised?&#34; She folded her arms on her chest while staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just about to help those children from earlier but someone is got here first.&#34; What am I saying? That was a complete bullshit. She chuckle at my excuse. That was really a lame excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay I will let this one slide.&#34; She turn her back at me and started walking away. What&#39;s wrong with me? What am I doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you around Mr.&#34; I heard her said before I lose her. I don&#39;t know what made me follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s your type huh?&#34; I smack Eliot on his shoulders, he was watching us this whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I&#39;m surprised myself, I can&#39;t wait to tell Klaire about this. The famous cold hearted Yustef can also feel embarrassed towards a beautiful woman.&#34; And he started laughing, I just shake my head and left him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got back to the room we rented, he was still laughing his ass out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you stop Eliot.&#34; I uttered with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay okay.&#34; He wipe the tears in his eyes from laughing so hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway did you notice that this town is weird?&#34; Now that he mentioned, I notice that my senses was weakened. Like earlier when I didn&#39;t notice that she was a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That woman is a werewolf.&#34; I mumbled and he look surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you followed her? But how come I didn&#39;t even notice it?&#34; Now we were asking the same question. I walk to the window, watching the snow fall heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This might also be the reason why we can&#39;t track those kidnappers.&#34; I couldn&#39;t agree more to what he was saying. It only means that we are not the only werewolf around this town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the night fall, the snow is too think making it hard to walk around and the people are now inside their houses. We decided that we will look for clues separately, I found myself into the same place where I saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The children from earlier are not here anymore, I hope they are both fine because this kind of weather will kill them from cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk towards the direction where she left from earlier. I hurried my pace when I smelled the metallic scent of blood, when I turn to the next corridor I found her laying on the ground. She was bleeding heavily. I ran towards her and pulled her in my arms. I tap her face slowly and she open her lids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay? Who did this to you?&#34;  I caught the fainting scent of werewolves, rogues...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Red eye rogues.&#34; Was the last thing she mumbled before she lost consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her abdomen is bleeding heavily, she will die if I will leave her alone. I mind link Eliot and told him I found someone who was attacked by rouges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carried her back to our rented room. I place her in my bed. She was bleeding heavily, I need to make this quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rip her dress, she was bitten good thing it didn&#39;t reach her weak spot. I grab the first aid kit in the corner of the room and started treating her. Werewolves have a high speed of recovering but when the wounds are too deep we need to used some methods to treat them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened here?&#34; Eliot was carrying some medicine that I told him to pick up when he returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was attacked. I saw some traces of the children we saw last time. She was probably attacked because she was protecting them.&#34; Eliot help me treat her wounds and when she woke up it was already morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where am I? And you!&#34; When she already recognize me she look surprised to see me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? Where am I?&#34; When she notice her clothes was different she glared at me. &#34;What did you do to me?!&#34; She shouted. And started throwing pillows at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no choice but to let you borrow my clothes because yours are rip into pieces, and you are here in our room, and about why you are here, I found you at the corridor where I last saw you and you are bleeding to death.&#34; She calm down when I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait where are the children???&#34; She cannot hide the horror on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened there? Tell me everything.&#34; I pulled the chair closer to her then grab the glass of water next to me and gave it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was walking to check those children again because the snow is getting heavy and when I got there I notice some rogues took them and I followed them they tried to take them away and I tried to stop them but then they are too many and too strong. The next thing I know someone attacked me and  then when I woke up I was here.&#34; She mumbled, her lips and trembling as she hug herself. She looks frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which pack are you from?&#34; She was stunned at my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d rather not say it. I run away from home.&#34; She answered. Eliot looks at me with a narrow eyes. Muttering that she was suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, now all you have to do is rest.&#34; As I took the glass away from her. The same electric sparks travel to my body. I tried to ignored it and act normal. But failed, I hurriedly pull my hands away from her like I was burnt by something hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will leave you will Eliot. Don&#39;t worry you could trust him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before Eliot could object I was already pulling my coat on the rack and matching my way towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care.&#34; Was the last thing I heard from her but it felt like it was the first thing someone ever told me something like that. I was feeling more motivated to look for those abductors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And who ever those are I will make them suffer after what they did to her. Wait! This has nothing to do with her. It was all because of our mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to where she was, I found nothing not even a traces that could lead me towards who planned everything. Not even a scent was presence in the location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed there for a while, hiding somewhere that they wouldn&#39;t be able to locate me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no one came, even if there are still children walking around no one came. Are they perhaps aware that we are here? So they move to another place? But no that doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to the place we rent, Eliot was waiting for me at the door step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I ask, he looks up and muttered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was missing, I just told her that I would grab something to eat and when I returned she was gone.&#34; I don&#39;t know why I was so mad when I heard that she left. This is actually expected already but was expecting to see her when I returned. I even picked some flowers on my way here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I heard that flowers make a woman smile. And by her look earlier she was too frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to watch her!&#34; I cannot help my self and shove Eliot away from the door. And when I got inside she was not there anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fill of emptiness swamp at me as I stare at my bed which is now empty. Only her strawberry scent left was left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Yus! What is wrong with you? Why are you acting like that towards just one woman! You don&#39;t even care about them before!&#34; Eliot barge in the room and became silent when he saw my state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck! Yustef don&#39;t tell me she was...&#34; He trailed off, then gasp when he notice that I wasn&#39;t saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right... She was my mate.&#34; I was finally able to say those words that I was avoiding since I first saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the first time I met her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot gave up like that.&#34; She muttered, I smiled at her. Brushing her hair to the back of her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t like it. But this is the only way.&#34; I mumbled then kissed her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to burst into anger again but she stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still can&#39;t believe that you will give up your life just for her.&#34; Her words was in a mixture of jealousy. And I couldn&#39;t stop myself to smile. She looks adorable right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t smile at me like that! I was very angry right now!&#34; She mumbled. I stroke her cheeks, wiping away the remaining marks of her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but there is still I chance that we might survive. So stop acting like we will die.&#34; I uttered, she just rolled her eyes at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to go.&#34; She mumbled then letting go of my hand as I let her go. Ali was already looking for her. And as much as I don&#39;t want her to be near him. I couldn&#39;t do anything because I can&#39;t be the man standing next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stayed there as she turned her back on me. Hips swaying along with her skirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t forgive you if you die!&#34; she mumbled before she finally leave my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looks like I wouldn&#39;t be forgiven.</p>
