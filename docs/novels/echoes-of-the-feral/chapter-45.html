                <p>The pack was still watching her, standing at the edges of the ruins, their golden eyes reflecting the flickering torchlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had followed her this far, but now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they needed more than just a leader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They needed a reason to keep fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reason to believe this war wasn&#39;t already lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face them, her pulse steady, her voice clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t lie to you,&#34; she said, scanning the crowd. &#34;What happened tonight wasn&#39;t a victory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the wolves shifted uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t here to comfort them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was here to tell them the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caius left because he wanted to,&#34; she continued. &#34;Because this was never the real fight. Because he thinks he&#39;s already won.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the words settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the weight of them sink into the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she took a step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of something passed through the pack, a spark, a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you feel it?&#34; she asked, her voice quieter now. &#34;The shift? The way the ruins responded to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they felt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could see it in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slow realization that the past wasn&#39;t just something to be uncovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was something that could be rewritten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not just fighting against him,&#34; Riley said. &#34;We&#39;re fighting against the ones who erased me before. The ones who controlled Tobias. The ones who still believe they own this war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the silence stretch, let the wind carry the weight of her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them believe that,&#34; she murmured. &#34;Let them think they still hold the leash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because the moment they see what we&#39;ve become it&#39;ll be too late for them to stop us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low growl rumbled through the crowd, the tension shifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a low whistle, smirking. &#34;Damn, sweetheart. That was almost inspiring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley shot her a look, but she could see it in Lena&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t mocking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so was the rest of the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped forward, his golden eyes dark and unreadable. &#34;So what&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because that&#39;s what they needed now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not speeches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley had one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent too long playing defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time to move first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We find out what Caius is after,&#34; she said. &#34;And then we take it from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Past Worth Burning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved as one, leaving the ruins behind, following Riley through the thick forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t need to ask where they were going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they already knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there were answers to be found, they weren&#39;t in the ruins anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were in the one place Tobias had always refused to let her see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silverwood had always had secrets, but none ran deeper than the ones buried inside the walls of the pack&#39;s fortress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley was done waiting for permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moonlight barely pierced through the thick canopy above them, but she could see perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The presence of the wolves at her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The distant, lingering scent of Caius&#39;s wolves, now miles behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heartbeat of the forest itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was awake now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And nothing could stop her from taking what was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The estate was just ahead, the massive structure barely visible through the trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran slowed beside her. &#34;Are we sure about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena grinned. &#34;Good enough for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the perimeter, where the dense forest met the open clearing of the estate&#39;s grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack fanned out, silent, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobias had ruled from inside those walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius had hunted her from the shadows beyond them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was walking straight through the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;If we do this, we don&#39;t get to undo it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s make it count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reckoning in the dark</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first guard never saw her coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One moment he was standing watch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next, Riley slammed him into the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No time for hesitation. No time for warnings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been hunting her since the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was her turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack swept forward, silent and lethal, slipping through the shadows like they had always belonged here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe, in a way, they had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley moved fast, slipping past the outer walls, her heart steady, her pulse even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The estate was built from stone and wood, an old fortress that had stood long before Tobias had ever called himself Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had always felt like a cage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, it felt like a battlefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran caught up beside her. &#34;Where are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the part of the estate that only Tobias and his most trusted wolves had ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the part that held secrets, no one had ever spoken of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the part where, if she was right</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would finally learn why they had erased her in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The halls were eerily silent as they moved deeper into the fortress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley could feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The presence in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The watching eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavy, iron-bound, old as the estate itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers grazed over the surface, and a sharp shock of energy pulsed through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory trying to surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been here before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And whatever was on the other side</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was meant for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran glanced at her, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena cracked her knuckles, grinning. &#34;I swear, if there&#39;s some ancient monster in there, I&#39;m gonna be pissed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley huffed a quiet breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And everything changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chamber beyond the door was vast, lined with torches that burned too bright, too strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And at the center</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive stone tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just any tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carved into stone, telling the story they had tried to erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, her heart slamming against her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were in a language she shouldn&#39;t have understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they were hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they told the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth of who she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth of who Caius had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the truth of why he had betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley inhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because in that moment, as the past unraveled before her, one thing became clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius hadn&#39;t been hunting her just to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been hunting her because he was afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid of what she would become if she remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid of the war she would bring to his doorstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he had every reason to be afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Riley wasn&#39;t just going to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to burn them all down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every piece of the past they had buried and thought she would never find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was carved into the stone before her, etched into time itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now that she had seen it, there was no undoing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flickering torchlight cast deep shadows across the chamber, making the carvings on the tablet shift and move as if they were alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s breath came slow and steady, but her pulse was roaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this wasn&#39;t just history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena stepped up beside her, her golden eyes scanning the tablet. &#34;So, sweetheart, you gonna tell us what&#39;s got you looking like you just saw a ghost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because in a way she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face them, her pack standing behind her, Kieran closest of all, his body tense with expectation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her to give them their next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her to step into the truth of who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the silence stretch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally, she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t just erase me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was quiet, dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They erased an entire war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley turned back to the carvings, her fingers tracing the edges of the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m saying this war didn&#39;t start with me and Tobias. Or even with Caius.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her green eyes burned as she looked at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It started long before any of us were reborn into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, sharp hush settled over the chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from the weight of memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from something alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that had felt her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that had been waiting for her to remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley knew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just woken up to something far worse than in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tremors beneath her feet weren&#39;t random.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t just the shifting of old stone or the weight of time pressing down on forgotten history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something ancient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack tensed around her, their golden eyes flickering in the dim torchlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stepped closer, muscles coiled, his stance protective. &#34;Riley,&#34; he said carefully. &#34;Tell me that&#39;s just the ruins settling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley exhaled, slow and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The carvings on the stone tablet glowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faint, barely noticeable, but enough to make the breath catch in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then the words moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not physically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in a way that should have been possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the symbols on the stone shifted and twisted, forming new shapes, and new meanings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like they were rewriting themselves for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like they had been waiting for her to see them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena let out a low whistle. &#34;Okay, yeah. Some ancient supernatural bullshit happening right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she wasn&#39;t just seeing the symbols anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was remembering them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stone beneath her fingers was cold and rough, but somewhere, deep in her bones, she knew what it should have felt like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smooth. New.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like it had been when she had last stood here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before everything had been ripped apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp breath left her lips as images flashed behind her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same ruins but not broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same words but freshly carved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same war but not yet lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And standing before her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as an enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as the betrayer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that made her chest ache in ways she didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was soft, urgent, desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you stay, they will kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, ripping herself out of the vision, and stumbling back from the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins groaned around them, the shaking intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something had felt her presence, her memories, her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran caught her wrist, grounding her. &#34;What did you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley&#39;s throat was dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the truth burned inside her now, undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t just erase me,&#34; she whispered. &#34;They made sure no one would ever find out what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back to the tablet, the glowing symbols reflecting in her green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t just history.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at them all now her pack, her wolves, her army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trembling beneath them grew stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was waking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that had been waiting for her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Riley knew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t leaving these ruins without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shaking grew worse, the deep groan of stone grinding against stone echoing through the cavern like the earth itself was coming undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dust rained from the ceiling, and the torches lining the walls flickered wildly, their flames dancing as if they, too, could feel the shift in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley stood her ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had faced Tobias. She had faced Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t a war waged between rival packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t about dominance, power, or revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that I had been watching. Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now that she had touched the past, now that she had begun to piece together what had been stolen from her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had found her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s grip on her wrist tightened. &#34;Riley, we need to move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the tablet was still glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it was speaking to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The symbols burned brighter, and suddenly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not from the wolves behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the ruins themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The past is never buried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It only waits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now, it has come for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pulse of pure energy slammed into her chest, knocking her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran lunged to catch her, but she barely felt his hands on her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the moment she hit the ground</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past crashed over her like a tidal wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere golden and burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The throne room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The banners of her kingdom fluttered in the wind, embroidered with symbols she had once known as well as her own name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And standing before her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as the man she had fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as the enemy she had sworn to destroy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as someone who had once stood beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was never supposed to happen,&#34; he said, his voice raw, his golden eyes dark with something too heavy to name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley felt herself answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as she was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she had been before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you betray me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And at that moment, she saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The betrayal had never been about power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had never been about control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been about saving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or at least, that&#39;s what he had believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because in the next instant, the doors to the throne room burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of darkness crashed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that had come to erase her from history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Caius</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius had chosen their side to stop them from killing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had died anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision ripped away as a deafening crack split the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Riley gasped, snapping back into the present, Kieran shouting her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruins were collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past was trying to bury her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to be erased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved herself upright, eyes blazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re getting out of here,&#34; she said, voice sharper than steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena cursed. &#34;Finally. Thought you were gonna let yourself get crushed for a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolves were already moving, following her lead, sprinting for the exit as the ruins continued to shake, stone crumbling around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran stayed beside her, his golden eyes flicking toward her, worried, questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Riley couldn&#39;t look at him yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she wasn&#39;t just running out of the ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was running straight into a truth she could no longer deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caius hadn&#39;t betrayed her out of cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had betrayed her because he had thought it was the only way to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, after all these years</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come back to finish what he started.</p>
